52,2017-11-27 04:00,Absolutely. Any RTK grade steering system should be using as many decimals as possible up to that point. It’s just past that your adding noise.

932,2018-01-02 10:00,I think Chris's point is that 51 satoshis/vbyte would be sufficient for the higher fee transaction to be included. Anything above that is a donation to the miner.

948,2017-12-10 12:00,I'm suggesting that @bitpay reduce costs users today by rolling out better technology. @spair 's preferred way forward (2X) was a plan to instead just externalize those costs onto the network.
949,2017-12-10 12:00,"SegWit transactions: give immediate fee relief, regardless of network adoption. As far as I'm aware, @bitpay do not use SegWit transactions yet."
950,2017-12-10 12:00,"Unidirectional payment channels: have been well-understood and deployable for at least 5 years. Steam (small, semi-regular txs to a single recipient) would be a perfect use case. Why hasn't @bitpay started rolling out payment channels?"
951,2017-12-10 12:00,"Appropriate fee estimation: The chairman of @bitpay , @TonyGallippi , showed that he has no understanding of fee estimation and that @bitpay customers are overpaying by orders of magnitude: https:// twitter.com/jfnewbery/stat us/931375233822584832 …"
952,2017-12-10 12:00,@bitpay just lost a big customer because fees were too high. They have the opportunity to reduce fees for customers today by deploying well understood technology: - appropriate fee estimation - unidirectional payment channels - SegWit transactions

971,2017-11-24 16:00,Well I certainly learned something. I'm going to have to check out Extreme Ownership.
972,2017-11-24 16:00,Excellent exposition and analysis of the 2x bugs. Great work from @pierre_rochard and @bitstein (and @jimmysong for the source material). https:// twitter.com/pierre_rochard /status/934185750622588928 …
973,2017-11-20 15:00,You mean a test that wasn't actually testing the new mining code (and if it was you would have realised how broken your code was)?
974,2017-11-20 15:00,You mean this bit: https:// github.com/btc1/bitcoin/b lob/segwit2x/qa/rpc-tests/fork-large-block.py#L195 … that was testing the size of the block at the wrong height? You mean a test that was merged with no review: https:// github.com/btc1/bitcoin/p ull/83 …
975,2017-11-20 15:00,"I've been contributing to Bitcoin Core for about a year and I hardly ever touch consensus code. When I do, I write PR comments like this: https:// github.com/bitcoin/bitcoi n/pull/11389#pullrequestreview-69600608 … begging for review and test!"
976,2017-11-20 15:00,I'm not sure that's the right lesson. I think better lessons are: have humility when touching consensus code; accept that it's difficult and there will be edge cases that you haven't thought of; have as many eyes reviewing it and testing it as possible.
977,2017-11-19 08:00,I'm by no means the first person to say this!
978,2017-11-19 07:00,Really @jgarzik ? That's what you learned? How about these lessons: 1. Changes to Bitcoin require consensus from the users and can't be dictated by a closed group. 2. No-one should run untested and unreviewed code from a one-man development team. pic.twitter.com/bkhE1SoaEP
979,2017-11-18 16:00,"Yes, and I think that means that for most miners, if they'd set -blockmaxsize"" before the hard fork height as was suggested, then they would have been mining invalid large blocks before the correct height. nBlockMaxSize is completely independent from block height."""
980,2017-11-18 08:00,I hadn't read that before. Thank you - it really resonates.
981,2017-11-18 08:00,Clarification: I didn't reveal the off-by-one bug. I think I first read about it on @AaronvanW 's feed. I also wasn't the first to see the uninitialized fWitnessSeasoned bug.
982,2017-11-17 21:00,"Hardly any of it is my code, but I appreciate the kind words. Thanks!"

986,2017-11-17 16:00,"Can someone with better knowledge of C++ clarify this for me? Jeff claimed on btc1 slack that this would default to false, but I'm not sure that's actually the case."
987,2017-11-17 15:00,"Anyway, I don't think we're going to resolve this on twitter, but I'd be happy to chat next time I see you in person."
988,2017-11-17 14:00,"You know me and you know I've repeatedly argued against demonising people who supported NYA, even though I've always opposed it myself."
989,2017-11-17 14:00,> The reason people like me go on about this distinction is false accusations of malice deepen Balkanization. Good! I agree tribalism is bad. My point is that *I* no longer believe that Jeff is acting with good intent. You conclusion may be different from mine. That's ok.
990,2017-11-17 14:00,"Not true - NYA proponents repeatedly stated that strong replay protection was not included so SPV clients would follow the 2x chain, and that the intent was to kill the original chain so that there was only one coin."
991,2017-11-17 14:00,"As far as I'm aware, Adam has never contributed any code to BCash. Ryan, I think you're barking up the wrong tree here."
992,2017-11-17 13:00,"By the way, it's possible that some of that ad-hoc replay protection relied on block 494,784 being the fork block. If SegWit2x had forked, people could have lost money due to the off-by-one bug."
993,2017-11-17 13:00,"> much of the work to mitigate disruption is already done No work was done by btc1 to mitigate disruption. That cost was externalized onto businesses and individuals in the Bitcoin community, who had to spend many hours creating ad-hoc replay protection."
994,2017-11-17 12:00,"Yet he continues to write code for SegWit2x even though the 'upgrade' story isn't possible. There's no consensus. Backers have backed out. If he wants SegWit2x to be an alternative coin, he should include replay protection, etc. However you slice this, it looks bad."
995,2017-11-17 12:00,"Jeff's stated intention was never to create a new forked coin. He and the other NYA promoters wanted to 'upgrade' Bitcoin and kill the old chain. Hence no replay protection, service bit hiding, no new network magic."
996,2017-11-17 12:00,"That's not really true. I completely support peoples' right to exit Bitcoin and create a fork. If they want to do that using a UTXO snapshot, then they have a responsibility to minimize disruption to the original chain."
997,2017-11-17 10:00,"Forking now, when it's clear that SegWit2x does not have consensus, would simply cause disruption for Bitcoin. That's why I no longer believe that Jeff is acting with good intent."
998,2017-11-17 10:00,"Yes - he's telling people to run the patches, which would cause a hard fork. Remember - SegWit2x can only succeed by becoming the one true chain. See https:// github.com/btc1/bitcoin/i ssues/99#issuecomment-320450248 … for example. That's why there's no replay protection."
999,2017-11-17 10:00,Why is Jeff writing code *today* to create a hard fork and telling people to run it? He and 5 other NYA signers announced SegWit2x was dead last week. It clearly does not have consensus. The only thing running the forking code can do now is cause disruption.
1000,2017-11-17 09:00,what if I don't want to?
1001,2017-11-17 09:00,"In case it's not clear: no-one should run btc1 code. It is untested, unreviewed, buggy and can only serve to disrupt and confuse the Bitcoin network."
1002,2017-11-17 09:00,"There are more bugs in the btc1 code. I can't in good conscience reveal what those are, since I have no intention of helping create a disruptive hard fork."
1003,2017-11-17 09:00,"Trying to create a SegWit2x fork at this point, when it's clear that it doesn't have consensus, is simply sowing discord and confusion."
1004,2017-11-17 09:00,In case it's not clear: SegWit2x only makes sense if it has consensus and can bring the network with it. That's what we were told again and again: 2x is an upgrade and will become the one true chain.
1005,2017-11-17 09:00,"When I pointed this out to Jeff, he immediately created a patch and pushed it out."
1006,2017-11-17 09:00,This is a simple bug. Any reasonably competent coder would have spotted this (not least because a compiler or static analysis could have warned that a member was being accessed before initialization). Any reasonable review process would have caught this. Sadly btc1 had neither.
1007,2017-11-17 09:00,"I then took a look at the miner activation code. There's another bug there. In the BlockAssembler constructor code, fWitnessSeasoned is being accessed before initialization. The result: no large block can be mined to trigger the fork."
1008,2017-11-17 09:00,"Looking at the code, it appears that Jeff made an off-by-one error. That's not entirely surprising. The VersionBitsState() code is confusing, and the commit where Jeff added the hard fork code had no review: https:// github.com/btc1/bitcoin/p ull/50 … ."
1009,2017-11-17 09:00,"Block 494,784 was announced an discussed as the forking block many times over the last few months.

1010,2017-11-17 09:00,"Segwit2x was announced abandoned last week, but there are still some residual nodes in the network. This morning, those nodes froze at block 494,782. That's two blocks before the intended hard fork at 494,784."
1011,2017-11-17 09:00,"I try to assume good intentions in people. Unfortunately, I can no longer do so for @jgarzik . My judgement is that he is acting to disrupt the bitcoin network to advance his own interests."
1012,2017-11-16 21:00,"I'm not blaming the users. Executives of Bitcoin services companies have a duty to minimize fees for users. If they don't, their customers should complain, or take their business elsewhere!"
1013,2017-11-16 21:00,"Tony, the median feerate for the previous 3 blocks (494722-494724) was 22 sat/vbyte, giving a fee of under 5,000 satoshis for a standard transaction. Your fee is 20x too high.

1015,2017-11-12 10:00,Great! We're in total agreement. Can we stop using the mean when describing fees in bitcoin?
1016,2017-11-12 07:00,Absolutely correct! The context for this tweet perhaps isn't clear. Several prominent people have been trying to argue using mean fee for a single block. I hope this illustrates how misleading that measure is.
1017,2017-11-12 07:00,Used a small sample size and an inappropriate measure to produce a misleading statistic.

1073,2017-11-06 12:00,"If you were willing to wait that long, your transaction would have been confirmed with very low fees."
1074,2017-11-06 12:00,"Often, it's fine to wait 24 hours for your transaction to be confirmed. If your primary concern is fees, you can save a lot this way."
1075,2017-11-06 12:00,"Doing that gives us a feerate of 191 sat/byte, so an implied fee of $3.10."
1076,2017-11-06 12:00,That gives us a good measure of what fee rate would be required to get in one of those blocks.
1077,2017-11-06 12:00,We should look for the minimum of the 80th centiles for the block and the 5 subsequent blocks.
1078,2017-11-06 12:00,"But you probably don't want to optimize to include your transaction in the next block. If you can wait an hour, you'll get have lower fees."
1079,2017-11-06 12:00,"80th centile feerate is 260 sat/byte, so $4.22."
1080,2017-11-06 12:00,"... and it had this feerate, 20% of the transactions in the block would have a lower feerate. Your tx would almost certainly get included.)"
1081,2017-11-06 12:00,(why 80th centile? Because it means that if your transaction was in the mempool when this block was mined ...
1082,2017-11-06 12:00,"Of course, that single transaction could be out-of-band, or a stingy-parent-generous-child. Let's take the 80th centile feerate to be sure."
1083,2017-11-06 12:00,"Lowest feerate transaction in your block was https:// blockchain.info/tx/bdf2a264545 ecac76343358a9f193fc062fc5db8461ac2b6dc6b5f840914ae37 … , 101 sat/byte - which would be $1.63 for an average sized tx."
1084,2017-11-06 12:00,(No-one wins a prize for being the highest paying tx in a block. It's just additional miner surplus)
1085,2017-11-06 12:00,"But really, you want your transaction to have the *lowest* fee-rate of all txs in the block. That maximizes your consumer surplus."
1086,2017-11-06 12:00,"Doing that gives us a feerate of 264 sat/vB and vsize 226 . At $7176, the fee is $4.31. Ok, that's still pretty high."
1087,2017-11-06 12:00,A better average would be median feerate multiplied by median transaction vsize.
1088,2017-11-06 12:00,[that tx weighed 40vkB. It excluded everyone else on earth from using our most secure ledger for a whole minute for just $1800. Cheap!]
1089,2017-11-06 12:00,Your block had 1881 transactions. That means that tx 745879e... alone contributed about $1 to the 'average' fee.
1090,2017-11-06 12:00,That tx was almost 100k and paid $1876 in fees. Outliers like that affect the mean disproportionately.
1091,2017-11-06 12:00,"Firstly, mean tx fee is a really useless measure. For example, your block contains this tx: https:// blockchain.info/tx/745879e0481 6c2244bba3453004fc2d5b7a5d92c86f0e037d49cc822b2ed202c … ."

1698,2018-02-25 18:00,The incentives are different (regardless of the algorithm) because then the community has clear demonstrated (through precedent) that it can and will react defensively to such a threat.

1742,2018-02-25 12:00,"I mean there can only ever be one chain with actual usage. If people continue to use the current Bitcoin rules after the PoW change activates, the PoW change has failed and become an altcoin. Bitcoin remains as it was. This is why it's crucial to get consensus first."
1743,2018-02-25 12:00,"I have little expectation that the community will change its mind at this point. So long as that is the case, we cannot act. But the facts remain that it is something we SHOULD be doing, and as such, I will support an effort to do so, so long as it isn't yet another altcoin."

1745,2018-02-25 12:00,This is nonsense.
1746,2018-02-25 12:00,"Only users and merchants matter. There is no need to convince miners. Wallets, exchanges and developers exist only to serve the users, and must do what the users want. PoW change is much smaller than Segwit. There is no work to upgrade."

1748,2018-02-25 11:00,I don't see the point.
1749,2018-02-25 11:00,There wasn't even a problem in 2013 (to be solved by the hardfork). It was simply a new feature; one that in hindsight should have been rejected.

1751,2018-02-25 11:00,"Perhaps, but that's not what happened."
1752,2018-02-25 11:00,BCH and BTG are not hardforks either. They are just altcoins. Not notably any different from the altcoins before them.
1753,2018-02-25 11:00,Probably similar to https:// github.com/BitcoinHardfor k/bitcoin …
1754,2018-02-25 11:00,"That's not true. It is an altcoin, and nothing more."
1755,2018-02-25 11:00,"The goal is to get rid of any single/few entities who can control the network, no matter who or how. No one entity should control more than 10% total hashrate. No one country should have more than 30% either physically or remotely controlled from within its borders."
1756,2018-02-25 11:00,"No, it isn't. It was never intended to be, nor would a PoW change hardfork be done in that manner."
1757,2018-02-25 11:00,"Those are altcoins, not PoW changes or hardforks."
1758,2018-02-25 11:00,"Taxes are much higher for income, than for long-term capital gains... I pay my taxes, but not much more than I'm required to!"
1759,2018-02-25 11:00,Bingo.
1760,2018-02-25 11:00,"If Jihan wanted to, he could solve the problem overnight by diversely liquidating Bitmain's miner stock. Then we wouldn't even need a PoW change."
1761,2018-02-25 11:00,That doesn't follow at all. There has been no need for a hardfork since 2013 until the need for PoW change arose.
1762,2018-02-25 11:00,"No, Bitcoin would have had to cease to exist at the moment of BCH's launch. That didn't happen. BCH is strictly an altcoin now."
1763,2018-02-25 11:00,"No, BGold is an altcoin."
1764,2018-02-25 08:00,"Incompatibility with older nodes. If the original network continues to exist, the attempt to hardfork has failed and turned into an altcoin instead."
1765,2018-02-25 08:00,Many. But only one (in 2013 May) since it has gained notable value.
1766,2018-02-25 08:00,"Depends on what algorithm we change to. Assuming only GPUs can mine at first, the situation would be MUCH BETTER than it is today with SHA2. Hashpower in numbers matters less than diversity of miners."
1767,2018-02-25 08:00,"The Bitcoin community as a whole decides. So long as Bitcoin as-is continues to exist, any attempt to hardfork will result in yet another altcoin like BCH being created instead of Bitcoin itself being changed."
1768,2018-02-25 08:00,I don't recall what the market cap was in 2013. Are you saying Bitcoin value will need to drop to that level before the community will act to protect it?
1769,2018-02-25 07:00,Maybe. But softforks aren't much better than hardforks when virtually all mining hashrate will oppose it.
1770,2018-02-25 07:00,"Hopefully they will just switch to BCH. Again, centralised hashrate doesn't make security."
1771,2018-02-25 07:00,It's a can of worms. There's no rational basis to say two algorithms are equivalent at any hashrates.
1772,2018-02-25 07:00,Can of worms. How do you compare two diverged chains?
1773,2018-02-25 07:00,"The difference is, I'm not going to do it, unless the network chooses it first."
1774,2018-02-25 07:00,SHA2 has been centralised for years now.
1775,2018-02-25 07:00,"ASICs aren't the problem. The primary concern isn't number of manufacturers either, but who is actually running the miners. Right now, it's mostly a handful of people. If SHA2 becomes commoditized properly some day, we can talk about switching back. Changes can be both ways."
1776,2018-02-25 07:00,"The tonal system's advantages are all practical, though... (at least the ones I perceive - maybe there's a beauty I overlook as well?)"
1777,2018-02-25 07:00,"No, I had to write my own script to do it. Unfortunately, it's highly specific to my own exports. Maybe some day I will find a way to generalise it, but it seems like a big project. :("
1778,2018-02-25 07:00,"Yes, it is. That's what a real hardfork is. (BCH is not a hardfork.)"
1779,2018-02-25 07:00,"No, it's a comment that exposes the shortcomings of using the term fork"" for so many different things."""
1780,2018-02-24 22:00,"Why merely hope and do nothing? Changing PoW doesn't inhibit their entry, and if they choose a different algorithm, we can always change [back] to that."
1781,2018-02-24 22:00,"It wouldn't even be difficult. Just a few extra transistors, really. At least first-gen BFL hardware supported one, although it would be a pain to use (you'd need to disassemble the units to modify the firmware)."
1782,2018-02-24 21:00,"No, you're ridiculous."
1783,2018-02-24 21:00,"The backup algorithm would be a variant of SHA2 that isn't practical for competition to also support unaware of its existence. When the community agrees to change PoW, then we would just use these backup algorithms instead of SHA2."
1784,2018-02-24 21:00,"Even 6 months, in the worst case scenario. But it sets a precedent that heavily dis-incentivises doing so."
1785,2018-02-24 21:00,"The community changes the algorithm, not developers. Even if it wasn't likely to be necessary (which it clearly is today), a reasonable manufacturer that cares about Bitcoin's success would build in a backup just in case."
1786,2018-02-24 21:00,Ignoring my point doesn't make it any less valid.
1787,2018-02-24 21:00,Which is why we need to work on strong consensus for a PoW change.
1788,2018-02-24 21:00,"If manufacturers X, Y, and Z make SHA2 ASICs, which also support SHA2+X, SHA2+Y, and SHA2+Z, then when we stop allowing SHA2, we would want to use instead (SHA2+X or SHA2+Y) if it is SHA2+Z that is acting abusively/centralising the network."
1789,2018-02-24 21:00,Are you asserting that the competition has incompetently ignored the advice to support a backup algorithm?
1790,2018-02-24 21:00,"Not much, and only for the better."
1791,2018-02-24 21:00,"Why not? It's Coinbase that is providing the information, and it only makes sense to be sure they're aware they need to report it CORRECTLY."
1792,2018-02-24 21:00,Bitcoin has hardforked before just fine.
1793,2018-02-24 21:00,FIFO and LILO are literally the same thing...
1794,2018-02-24 21:00,Everyone using Bitcoin will want to mine it to keep it safe. The way it was always intended to be!
1795,2018-02-24 21:00,"If you don't have consensus, there can be no hardfork in the first place. That's beside the point."
1796,2018-02-24 21:00,"Large hashrate is irrelevant if it's centralised. Also, you can't even *compare* different algorithms."
1797,2018-02-24 21:00,Not if the competition paid attention to the advice ASIC manufacturers have been given since 2011: to support a backup algorithm. And we've had competition before. They went out of business.
1798,2018-02-24 21:00,Sounds like a good way to lose your privacy.
1799,2018-02-24 21:00,"BGold is an altcoin, not Bitcoin."
1800,2018-02-24 21:00,PoW change isn't a big change at all. It is much less significant than Segwit or even P2SH.
1801,2018-02-24 21:00,FUD. It is not radical at all. Just a minor change. SHA2 isn't particularly special.
1802,2018-02-24 20:00,That's one option. But hopefully @HalongMining built them to support a secondary/backup algorithm in case of PoW change. That's been the advice given to ASIC manufacturers since 2011.
1803,2018-02-24 20:00,None of the above...
1804,2018-02-24 20:00,That's more FUD. Changing the PoW is less of a change than adding Segwit was.
1805,2018-02-24 15:00,No. This is FUD. There is nothing nuclear about a PoW change.
1806,2018-02-24 14:00,"Why would someone re-centralise, when it's clear the community will change PoW as needed to prevent it? They would lose their investment. And even if they did anyway despite that, it would take several months at least."
1807,2018-02-24 14:00,Mining isn't meant to be invested it. It's meant to be done by everyone* as an expense to keep the network secure. Investors should build mining hardware because people are willing to buy it from them.

1810,2018-02-24 13:00,"A change of PoW is needed because SHA2 is no longer a decentralised PoW, but has become merely assigned-by-Bitmain."

1816,2018-02-24 13:00,"Sure, but that's beside the point. The network has never chosen to do a PoW change fork so far. That's no argument that it can't or shouldn't do one soon."

2017,2018-02-18 09:00,Both the Old Testament and New Testament testify to God's objective morality that never changes.
2018,2018-02-18 09:00,"Guns are less likely to kill, actually."
2019,2018-02-18 09:00,"Lots of death, everywhere. Less where guns are widespread."

2025,2018-02-18 08:00,"Whereas by this, as by that which followeth, patience only is signified and a will to suffer more, rather than to revenge. For neither did Christ nor St. Paul follow the letter by turning the other cheek. Io. 15. Act. 23."""""

2028,2018-02-18 08:00,There's no comparison.
2029,2018-02-18 08:00,I never said there wasn't. The problem is you ignoring non-gun violence as if it's somehow better than gun violence.
2030,2018-02-18 06:00,"Look for older stuff. Most things written since the Protestant Revolution are aimed at countering the errors of protestantism, rather than building up the Faith from scratch."

2039,2018-02-18 06:00,"Certainly less safe, but this can be partially addressed by being around other people (locals) who are armed. Guns aren't just an American thing."
2040,2018-02-17 22:00,"You have a right to defend yourself, your property, and your honour. Guns are necessary to effectively defend yourself and sometimes your property. Again, because the assailant will be physically stronger."

2044,2018-02-17 22:00,That's right. The Constitution is just a law. It cannot remove rights.
2045,2018-02-17 22:00,"Let's just say I will not agree to give up my guns under any circumstances. So an agreement will not be made. ;) (Okay, maybe if we had the opportunity to establish a Catholic monarchy, I might consider it... but then we'd probably get them right back. XD)"
2046,2018-02-17 22:00,Nobody has the authority to remove rights.
2047,2018-02-17 21:00,"No, all people only run if you've disarmed them."

2053,2018-02-17 20:00,"On the contrary, places with fewer guns have higher crime rates."
2054,2018-02-17 20:00,Again with the lies. Guns are NOT made the harm people.
2055,2018-02-17 20:00,"The criminals choose their victims. With no guns in the picture, they will obviously choose someone they can be certain to overpower."

2058,2018-02-17 20:00,"No, it isn't. The other way around is true."
2059,2018-02-17 20:00,"Sorry, but if you think gunless people are harmless, you're just plain delusional..."
2060,2018-02-17 20:00,"If taking their life is necessary to defending my rights from their wilful assault, then yes, I am justified in doing so. Florida also requires that when a gun is used in defense, we must have the intent to kill the perpetrator to avoid committing a crime, so in general also yes."
2061,2018-02-17 20:00,"If you need mental health care, you can get it. The problem is they very often misdiagnose and put people on drugs that they don't need, which ends up creating even worse mental problems."
2062,2018-02-17 20:00,"It's far too combined. The US has a lot of regions where guns are banned, and those regions are responsible for the highest murder rates. At the very least, take it State-by-State."
2063,2018-02-17 20:00,Guns are not created for harming/killing people.
2064,2018-02-17 20:00,It is a fact that many more people are protected from harm because individuals own guns. Removing guns does not make harming people any harder.
2065,2018-02-17 20:00,"Governments always fail at protecting people on a local level. You'd need a huge amount of the population policing constantly to be effective at that. Otherwise, the crime is over before the cops show up."
2066,2018-02-17 20:00,"Showed every statistic, you mean. School shootings happen because guns are banned from schools."
2067,2018-02-17 20:00,"Without guns, criminals WILL try because they know they will succeed with 90+% success rate. With enough guns, criminals will have to consider the risk of their victim being armed, and WON'T try (at least not as often)."
2068,2018-02-17 20:00,"Sorry, I don't respect your freedom"" to violate my rights and/or harm me. If anyone tries, I will use my gun(s) to stop them."""
2069,2018-02-17 20:00,Your error is assuming gun violence matters more than non-gun violence.
2070,2018-02-17 20:00,Guns are also created for living. Everyone should be trained.
2071,2018-02-17 20:00,One is justified to use force to defend their rights. The government does not have authority to void your rights either.
2072,2018-02-17 20:00,"Catholicism harshly condemns rape of anyone, children included."
2073,2018-02-17 20:00,It's pretty likely that the too-easy access to mental health care providers is at least at fault...
2074,2018-02-17 20:00,"There's plenty of vehicular homicides too. The mass media just doesn't make as much of a big deal about them, because it doesn't fit their agenda of banning guns."
2075,2018-02-17 20:00,"I guess we will probably never meet then. Even when I can't carry myself, I prefer to only be places where I know someone else is, and can defend us if needed."
2076,2018-02-17 20:00,"If nobody has guns, criminals will just use knives or their bare hands. Since they choose the victim, they can be near certain to always pick someone they know they can overpower. Guns in the hands of the would-be victims break this advantage."
2077,2018-02-17 20:00,Murder rate is higher in countries that ban guns. Try again.
2078,2018-02-17 20:00,You keep repeating this false claim. Repetition doesn't make it true.
2079,2018-02-17 20:00,You think teachers who just get shot and die is better than teachers who defend themselves and their class?
2080,2018-02-17 20:00,Yes they do.
2081,2018-02-17 20:00,Obviously for hunting.
2082,2018-02-17 20:00,You have it backward.
2083,2018-02-17 17:00,"Most people don't try. The ones that do, go behind bars. And no, you're not any more likely to fail without a gun. Guns just prevent you from succeeding when the other person has one."
2084,2018-02-17 17:00,"Welcome to reality, where people don't hurt each other over quarrels... Guns or not, if you do that, you'll go to jail."
2085,2018-02-17 17:00,"Eg, school shootings"
2086,2018-02-17 17:00,No. The tragedies are in places that ban guns.
2087,2018-02-17 17:00,"Sure, why not? You literally just defined it as a good idea.."
2088,2018-02-17 17:00,My children aren't teens.

2091,2018-02-17 17:00,You're the one playing stupid word games...
2092,2018-02-17 17:00,Obviously. Nobody said children can all handle guns. The law is because liberal tyrants wrote it.
2093,2018-02-17 17:00,I wouldn't *stop* my older children from carrying a knife - there's just no reason to do it. The law prohibits me from letting them carry a handgun.
2094,2018-02-17 17:00,Just because you don't like the conclusion doesn't make the analogy bad. (I think we should require every adult with care of someone else to carry a gun.)
2095,2018-02-17 17:00,You never know when you'll need it.
2096,2018-02-17 17:00,Knives are not effective for protection.

2100,2018-02-17 17:00,30 rounds is a reasonable number for any gun. Semi-automatic just means it reloads for you. The kind of round you load in it isn't an attribute of a gun.

2657,2018-02-05 20:00,"You need to receive the payment using your node. The easiest way to do that, is to have it sent to the node's built-in wallet. There's also a way to configure your hardware wallet to use your node itself, but that's more complicated."

2693,2018-02-03 13:00,Ethereum's approach is clearly wrong. Bitcoin wouldn't likely have been any better off if Satoshi hadn't disabled the opcodes - very few people have ever shown any interest in (actually useful) smart contracts to date.

2698,2018-02-03 13:00,"Blockstream pays only two developers at this point, and has never exerted any influence over the direction of their work (or anyone else's) on Bitcoin Core as far as I know. That's 100% pure FUD."
2699,2018-02-03 13:00,"The limit is to prevent miners from spamming too much, yes. But even 1 MB has proven to be too high a limit. Regardless, the limit isn't what is the cause of fees - the spam is. The spam will be a problem with bigger blocks too."

2705,2018-02-03 13:00,"The chain's work is irrelevant to the currency. The currency is defined first and foremost by the rules that enable nodes to come to consensus on the state of the system. The only way Bitcoin can be changed, is by the entire community going along with it."
2706,2018-02-03 13:00,"There is a real reason to hope for Bitcoin's long term success. As such, those who sell bitcoins are not doing so fraudulently. Even if Bitcoin later fails, it was not a scam, but an honest effort with reasonable hope of success."

2708,2018-02-03 13:00,"11/ Simply false. Segwit does not do what they claim. 12/ Satoshi disabled the mentioned opcodes. Bitcoin took a first step to restoring this functionality with Segwit, and progress is constantly made in that direction with MAST and similar."
2709,2018-02-03 13:00,"10/ Completely backward. While Bitcoin has ceased to be censorship resistant due to miner centralisation, the situation with BCH is far worse. Lightning is only an improvement to censorship resistance."
2710,2018-02-03 13:00,"9/ Bitcoin doesn't prevent combining as claimed. Incentives are an issue, but they are also an issue for BCH since they just copied Bitcoin in this respect. (Note that the incentive issue has been partially fixed moving forward in Bitcoin by Segwit.)"
2711,2018-02-03 13:00,"8/ False. There are SOME dev centralisation issues we face, but not the ones claimed here, & not ones that harm Bitcoin. It would be better if Core had less of a monopoly (there are alternatives), but at the end of the day, the community is deciding what software they will run."
2712,2018-02-03 13:00,"6/ It's easy to gain merchants when you have none, and easier to lose merchants when you have many. BCH launched in 2017, whereas Bitcoin has been around since 2009. 7/ Unfounded and false claim."
2713,2018-02-03 12:00,"5/ Bitcoin has never supported secure instant transactions, and blockchain technology alone doesn't make them possible. RBF was broken, but included in the original Bitcoin software. (Lightning does actually add the feature of secure instant transactions.)"
2714,2018-02-03 12:00,"3/ Cheap, fast, and secure aren't all possible under the conditions Bitcoin is experiencing. BCH has abandoned any effort to be secure, while Bitcoin has TEMPORARILY lost cheap. 4/ Bitcoin was designed from day 1 for off-chain payment channels."
2715,2018-02-03 12:00,"1/ Everyone agrees low fees are preferable, but that doesn't change the technical reality of what is possible when spam attacks occur. 2/ Bitcoin is a reliable network; claims made therein that it isn't are nonsensical."

2717,2018-02-03 12:00,"Calling BCH bcash"" is not inherently trolling. It is a natural result of the BCH leadership insisting on the fraudulent ""Bitcoin Cash"" name. If BCH leadership came up with an honest name, I think most people would be happy to use that name instead."""
2718,2018-02-03 12:00,"Also, the claims of censorship are mostly FUD. Some Bitcoin forums want to only have conversations about Bitcoin, not altcoins, and that's understandable - we should stick to forums that are okay with talking about BCH, if we want to discuss BCH."
2719,2018-02-03 12:00,"The only reason I'm aware of that BCH might be considered a scam, is because its proponents try to fraudulently pass it off as Bitcoin. If someone buys BCH thinking it is bitcoins, they are being scammed. Other than this one exception, I do not consider BCH (as BCH) to be a scam"
2720,2018-02-03 12:00,"BCH's direction is fundamentally different from Bitcoin's, so note that this typical reason probably does NOT apply to BCH, so long as the BCH developers actually move forward in some new way. (It's the reason for most altcoins being scams, however, including Litecoin)."
2721,2018-02-03 12:00,"Currencies are naturally scams unless they get significant, long-term real-world adoption. Otherwise, when the currency fails, every gain someone made, was at the expense of someone else who had an equal loss. In other words, it's a zero-sum game."
2722,2018-02-03 12:00,"It's a waste of time to continue to refute trolls over and over again. Read the many refutations people have already done in the past. Also, even if all those reasons were true (they're not), it wouldn't change the fact that BCH is still a different currency than Bitcoin."
2723,2018-02-02 22:00,"They're saying things that sound obvious, but in reality are fundamentally flawed. There is no <50%"" in a PoW change. You can't compare PoWs to each other at all."""

2740,2018-02-01 14:00,But existing nodes are not sufficient. That's like giving up on Bitcoin.
2741,2018-02-01 14:00,I don't understand?
2742,2018-02-01 11:00,"No, because too few are running nodes right now."
2743,2018-02-01 03:00,Context?
2744,2018-02-01 00:00,Able and willing are two different things.
2745,2018-01-31 18:00,See 2X for an example attack that could succeed if done in secret.
2746,2018-01-31 18:00,That's not relevant. It's users that aren't running their own full node either way.
2747,2018-01-31 18:00,Too many are unable to run full nodes with 1 MB blocks. Even the 2-4 MB increase bundled with Segwit was too much.
2748,2018-01-31 13:00,"Yes, as well as users using Coinbase or other such shared wallets."
2749,2018-01-31 13:00,It's not that important. Bitcoin itself loses its network-wide security if non-full nodes make up much more than ~15% of the network.
2750,2018-01-31 12:00,You're correct.
2751,2018-01-31 11:00,A fixed size of 3 MB is already a 100% increase to the blockchain size over the next year.

2759,2018-01-30 07:00,"Lightning reduces the on-chain data requirements of legitimate usage, such that spam pushing fees up will matter much less to real users."
2760,2018-01-30 07:00,"That's my point. Modern computers themselves are more complicated than all of Bitcoin (including Lightning) combined. If you really go back to simple"" (ie, ~1990s technology and a dumb blockchain), what you have left will have no chance of worldwide adoption, period."""
2761,2018-01-29 23:00,"The whitepaper didn't go into much details at all. It was indeed what Satoshi had in mind, however: the original 0.1 code had the basis for it already, and he discussed it online with others. It only became known as Lightning"" when it took on a more concrete form."""
2762,2018-01-29 23:00,"Sure you can. Besides, Bitcoin already depends on many people being online. If all the nodes shut off, it wouldn't work anymore."
2763,2018-01-29 23:00,"I guess you'd better go back to using an abacus then (or maybe finger math). General-purpose computers are insanely complex in comparison to both the blockchain *and* Lightning. Just look at Spectre! P.S. Lightning is PART of Bitcoin, not something separate."

2767,2018-01-29 22:00,"And even if it were true, BCH would still be an altcoin, since it still isn't Bitcoin."
2768,2018-01-29 22:00,"Your premise (that BCH follows the paper strictly"") is false."""
2769,2018-01-29 22:00,"Bitcoin was designed with such a second layer in mind, and the second layer doesn't take away from any of the properties described in the whitepaper (it only improves them)."
2770,2018-01-29 22:00,"The whitepaper never went into the structure of data (ironically, the pseudo-structure pictures are a closer match to Segwit than the original structure). Block size was always capped, and must be capped to have a working system."
2771,2018-01-29 22:00,"Ironically, that's what we ended up with (BIP148)."
2772,2018-01-29 22:00,"Yes and no. He's talking about two things here. One is a prediction that tech improvements will keep up with adoption; that failed around 300k block sizes. The other is a prediction that miners will move to GPUs. That did happen, but we're long past that now."
2773,2018-01-29 22:00,The actual resource requirements for transactions is too high. Lightning brings that down.
2774,2018-01-29 22:00,"Block headers are 80 bytes no matter what the block size is. The whitepaper is correct that it will almost never be a problem to store headers. Totally irrelevant to the topic, however."
2775,2018-01-29 22:00,"No, Lightning is a p2p layer-2. It only *improves* the currency property. Moores Law has never applied to bandwidth, and never held true for the overall needs of Bitcoin. Besides, it would only allow for a doubling every so often, which is currently 2-3 MB blocks."
2776,2018-01-29 22:00,"With Bitcoin... 1) You can actually be a peer still, by running a full node; 2) Lightning is *actually* peer-to-peer (whereas blockchains are merely flood/broadcast). BCH's road is lacking in both. With BCH, you will soon only be able to be a light wallet trusting someone else."
2777,2018-01-29 22:00,You sound confused. BCH is NOT a closer match in the first place.
2778,2018-01-29 21:00,"Because nothing has been fixed. As soon as the spammer(s) start up again, fees will rise (unless we get Lightning deployed first)."
2779,2018-01-29 21:00,"It's still wrong. Segwit does NOT split transactions, and does NOT make them more compact. And BCH is NOT a hardfork; it is an altcoin."

2783,2018-01-29 15:00,That's nothing short of a lie.
2784,2018-01-29 15:00,"Any merchants adopting BCH (most of which retain their support of Bitcoin) are doing so as a separate currency, not as a reorganization of the Bitcoin chain. Nobody is claiming transactions confirmed on Bitcoin, but not on BCH, are fraudulent or counterfeit."
2785,2018-01-29 15:00,"No, because you are trolling, and this is getting more and more obvious. I will probably just block you, after it has become obvious enough that any reader will see it too."
2786,2018-01-29 15:00,"It's not ridiculously specific - it's specific enough to be clear and to the point, so that it serves the purpose for which it was intended: to describe a kind of CHANGE to an EXISTING system. When you make a new system, it isn't that at all."
2787,2018-01-29 15:00,"The economy ALREADY didn't follow BCH. You can't change the past in the future. This is common sense, not special pleading."

2793,2018-01-29 15:00,"It wouldn't sync with the current blockchain because we had a hardfork in 2013. If you used a circa 2013 client, it would sync just fine. Yes, if you starting mining an old chain, you'd be making an altcoin, because the economy has already moved on."
2794,2018-01-29 15:00,The difference between altcoins and hardforks has ALWAYS been adoption by the economy. That's why they're two different things in the first place.
2795,2018-01-29 15:00,"No, you're simply wrong."
2796,2018-01-29 15:00,"You asked what it's called. And no, it wasn't created by hardfork. Anyone calling BCH a hardfork doesn't know what a hardfork is."
2797,2018-01-29 15:00,"No, the weight calculation makes more sense than the byte calculation in some ways, and we will need larger blocks eventually. Users should simply avoid using Segwit when malleability is not a problem, and miners should soft-limit their blocks to 750k until more is needed."

2800,2018-01-29 15:00,"Because Segwit is a feature, and one that should only be used when needed due to the harmful side-effects. It is unlikely there will be a legitimate use case for Segwit until Lightning is production-ready."

2802,2018-01-29 15:00,I never claimed hardforks by definition creation altcoins... BCH is not a hardfork. It is ONLY an altcoin.
2803,2018-01-29 15:00,"It's better to not use Segwit, because when you don't care about malleability, the only effect is increasing the block size, which is harmful to Bitcoin's decentralisation."
2804,2018-01-29 15:00,"It would have failed because Segwit only had ~80% support, not consensus. So the 20% remaining would have continued using the pre-Segwit Bitcoin."

2806,2018-01-29 15:00,"Segwit is as backwards compatible as *any* softfork is: old nodes will accept the Segwit chain as valid. If you use such an old node to send a Segwit-invalid transaction, yes, that node will rebroadcast it, but it will never get into the blockchain."

2811,2018-01-29 15:00,"Segwit was backward compatible, so the previous system was inherently replaced by the new one. If you ran the previous node, it would follow along with the Segwit chain as-is. This is why softforks are fundamentally more practical to deploy."
2812,2018-01-29 15:00,"Now you're just denying facts. When BCH started, it DID create a new system. To claim a hardfork, you need to show that the original system ceased to exist, but when BCH began, Bitcoin continued on as normal. It isn't even debatable."
2813,2018-01-29 14:00,"Both of your examples are changes to an existing system. But when BCH was created, it wasn't a change to an existing system, it was the creation of a new system."

3115,2018-01-15 17:00,Right.
3116,2018-01-15 17:00,Infrastructure can't even reasonable handle 1 MB yet.

3118,2018-01-15 17:00,Increasing 1 MB to 2 MB merely doubles capacity. That's what linear means. Worse still: it has an exponential *cost*.

3200,2018-01-14 23:00,"Even if Blockstream had control of Bitcoin (it doesn't), BCH wouldn't have solved that because BCH is not Bitcoin."
3201,2018-01-14 23:00,"Yes, and then the only way to bring the cost of real transactions down, is to make them more efficient. That's what Lightning, MAST, and signature aggregation do."
3202,2018-01-14 23:00,You don't need authority to state facts in English.
3203,2018-01-14 23:00,Obviously you don't know what you're talking about.
3204,2018-01-14 23:00,I learned.
3205,2018-01-14 23:00,Step 2 is to make the real transactions cheaper by reducing their relative data usage. Lightning does this. MAST does this. Signature aggregation does this.
3206,2018-01-14 23:00,I didn't know you were also a troll?
3207,2018-01-14 23:00,"Now this is just delusional. Do you think spam email doesn't exist, because emails are legitimate if they get past your filter???"
3208,2018-01-14 23:00,Entirely possible. I didn't mean to imply BCH is behind the attacks.
3209,2018-01-14 23:00,It's pretty much impractical these days.
3210,2018-01-14 23:00,"The only way to get your non-spam transaction through now, is to outbid it in fees. And there you have why fees are high..."
3211,2018-01-14 23:00,"Spam transactions. If it wasn't being attacked, we'd still have fee-less transactions getting confirmed."
3212,2018-01-14 23:00,What makes you think your coins exist on their fork? Or that their fork is going to be worth anything?
3213,2018-01-14 23:00,"If we knew that, maybe we could petition their local government to prosecute."
3214,2018-01-14 23:00,Miners don't verify blocks anymore (at least not before building on top). And miners have proven to be willing to unethically collaborate on such attacks (see 2X). The only thing holding it back is whether they can succeed or not - and that's when the economy is important.
3215,2018-01-14 23:00,"Transmitting a new block is about 256 bytes these days, regardless of the block size. Furthermore, almost all miners today use centralised backbones and skip the verification before they start building on top. So there is pretty much zero orphan"" block risk regardless of size."""
3216,2018-01-14 23:00,I'm not actually sure what the latest status of using zk-SNARKs like this is.
3217,2018-01-14 23:00,There are only two ways known to do that: 1) Verify the entire history yourself. This is what Bitcoin does. 2) Prove that the entire history was verified leading to that UTXO set. You would need to run the entire blockchain validation in a zk-SNARK.
3218,2018-01-14 23:00,Why do you assume the second layer adopted will be one Blockstream can profit from? Lightning is much cheaper.

3220,2018-01-14 23:00,Not even that.
3221,2018-01-14 23:00,"Sure, miners can reject low-fee transactions, but the demand is still there at $0. If BCH is spammed like Bitcoin, logically fees will end up being approximately the same range."
3222,2018-01-14 23:00,"Litecoin is nothing but a scam. It's not even worth talking about. (BCH is worth talking about, although I don't support it per se.)"
3223,2018-01-14 23:00,How do you figure the DAA works better? Seems to be generally accepted that their changes were a total failure... Signatures were just copied from Bitcoin/Segwit. Fees are lower only because nobody is attacking them.
3224,2018-01-14 23:00,Much less.
3225,2018-01-14 23:00,"That plan doesn't make too much sense to me, in light of Lightning. I suppose they can offer features not available in Bitcoin (yet), but block size doesn't come into that."
3226,2018-01-14 22:00,"(To not keep the entire history, just enable pruning. It just doesn't solve the issues.)"
3227,2018-01-14 22:00,"You don't need to *keep* the entire history. But unless you process and validate it, you *don't know* the UTXO set. Without knowing the UTXO set, you can't validate new blocks. Without validating new blocks, you can't validate new transactions."
3228,2018-01-14 22:00,Because you're a troll. Anyone who has actually used reddit knows it isn't censored.
3229,2018-01-14 22:00,"No, it isn't significantly more costly, because the difference between a penny and two pennies is negligible."
3230,2018-01-14 22:00,"Eventually, but probably not for a decade or two. (But if the network can one day do so without harming decentralisation, we can do it sooner.)"
3231,2018-01-14 22:00,It doesn't solve anything. The only reason they're cheaper/faster is because BCH isn't attacked as much as Bitcoin. Put the same level of attack on BCH and it will fail worse.
3232,2018-01-14 22:00,"It's been under attack for years now. If it wasn't, we'd still have free transactions."
3233,2018-01-14 22:00,"And what's the incentive for monetised second layers, with a fast, cheap, decentralised, p2p, trustless second layer?"
3234,2018-01-14 22:00,Transactions are cheap to generate.
3235,2018-01-14 22:00,"Lightning is a decentralised, p2p, trustless, and permissionless protocol..."
3236,2018-01-14 22:00,Demand is literally infinite once you get spammers. Block sizes don't matter at that point.
3237,2018-01-14 22:00,"I'm a moral person and therefore don't perform attacks (and the BCH community probably wouldn't all consent to it). It's not a solution at all, and it will destroy BCH long-term. It's well on the way there, even - BCH supporters already publicly say don't run a node""!"""
3238,2018-01-14 22:00,"Imagine if loading this Twitter page were 1.2 MB *more* for each user who views it. So the first person gets 1.2 MB, then the second has to load 2.4 MB; the third, 3.6 MB; and so on. You can't compare a CHANGE with a FIXED SIZE. They're just not the same at all."
3239,2018-01-14 22:00,Because you fail to understand the issues. Bitcoin isn't merely downloading a block every few minutes. New users need to download the ENTIRE HISTORY BACK TO 2009. That size is currently 150 GB and keeps growing faster than improvements to bandwidth and processing.
3240,2018-01-14 22:00,No more difficult than monetising smaller blocks...
3241,2018-01-14 22:00,"I encourage BCH to experiment in their own direction, but so far they've only regressed."
3242,2018-01-14 22:00,"Where did you get the idea that Bitcoin isn't? Sure, mining centralisation sucks, but Lightning will return p2p even despite that."
3243,2018-01-14 22:00,"Reminder: BCH doesn't solve anything. The only reason it has cheaper fees is because it's not being attacked as much as Bitcoin. Nobody likes high fees, but BCH is a step in the wrong direction to actually fixing the problems causing them."

3245,2018-01-14 14:00,"Not seriously. More of an idle curiosity, since nobody has donated 14000 BTC to me. :p"
3246,2018-01-14 14:00,"Yes, of course, I need to do that anyway since cap. gains still applies to gifts."
3247,2018-01-14 14:00,"Well, that FAQ seems to answer whether the gifts can be considered self employment income: since they don't nearly cover the value of the work I do on Bitcoin, obviously full consideration is not received in return."""""
3248,2018-01-14 14:00,"Whoa, that's actually even more complicated. I didn't realise FMV was used for calculating a loss. This sounds super-gameable..."
3249,2018-01-14 14:00,"It would really suck if people were paying cap. gains on what they donated to me, and then I paid cap. gains again for the same thing. :("
3250,2018-01-14 14:00,Apparently not under US or UK law. The cost basis is simply transferred with the property.
3251,2018-01-14 14:00,"(And if so, how does that work if the recipient is assuming a cost basis of $0 because he can't identify the donators?)"
3252,2018-01-14 14:00,"Wouldn't the limit apply to the cost basis of the donate bitcoins? So you could gift even 14000 BTC today tax-free, so long as you acquired them at a cost basis of under $1?"
3253,2018-01-14 14:00,"Yes, but the capital gains isn't exempt, only the gift itself."
3254,2018-01-14 04:00,"To be fair, it does seem that having insurance will be the most cost-effective way of handling pregnancies, so I did keep it this year anyway."
3255,2018-01-14 04:00,It's not mandatory anymore. :)
3256,2018-01-14 04:00,"Not that I am aware of. Health insurance might get taken out before taxes, so that's something I guess?"
3257,2018-01-14 03:00,But the conditions haven't changed either.
3258,2018-01-14 03:00,"I think in the US, you need to have children (and also be poor) to be entirely exempt from income tax. But in the US, they also take it out of employees paychecks upfront, so poor people don't necessarily need to file taxes."
3259,2018-01-14 03:00,"Dunno, I find it pretty awful still. I wish I could just get an invoice from the IRS for the amount owed."
3260,2018-01-13 21:00,"P.S. Miners get transaction fees, not developers."
3261,2018-01-13 21:00,"1) Because block size increases are harmful and stupid; 2) developers don't decide protocol changes, and there is no consensus for this one; 3) Segwit did increase the block size as recently as a few months ago"
3262,2018-01-13 19:00,A professional just confirmed my understanding: https:// twitter.com/EvanFox22/stat us/952370107841425408 …
3263,2018-01-13 19:00,"That's backward. If it was mined when bitcoins were worthless, the cost basis is zero, and therefore I owe capital gains on the full amount..."
3264,2018-01-13 19:00,How would it be zero?
3265,2018-01-13 19:00,"Yeah, that's wrong... but while they confuse Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin, it doesn't change the reality that Bitcoin Core is still a thing."
3266,2018-01-13 19:00,"Bitcoin is the system and currency. Bitcoin Core is an implementation of Bitcoin. They're both two different, but related, things. Bitcoin Knots, btcd, libbitcoin, etc are also implementations of Bitcoin, just like Bitcoin Core."

3579,2017-12-28 13:00,That initial sync in fact continues to grow indefinitely in time since the blockchain grows faster than improvement in processing blocks! (Tech improvements would break-even with ~300k/block average.)
3580,2017-12-28 13:00,"Today, the biggest problem is simply that they are choosing not to use full nodes, and the reason almost always comes down to the long time to perform the initial synchronisation."

3755,2017-12-24 07:00,"You don't have any arguments. Yes, it's just FUD."
3756,2017-12-24 07:00,Your claims are simply not true.
3757,2017-12-24 07:00,Blocks haven't been that big for those 5 years. It's only recently they've been reaching 1+ MB.
3758,2017-12-24 07:00,"If it breaks a drive, the drive was already defective."
3759,2017-12-24 07:00,Betrayer? Not at all.
3760,2017-12-24 07:00,Nodes mostly only matter if they're being used to verify transactions received by the node operator.
3761,2017-12-24 07:00,"Because 1) it's needed for Lightning, and 2) miners had no business blocking what the community wanted."
3762,2017-12-24 01:00,"Eh, I go right to left along the top, then left to right on the 2nd row, and so on..."
3763,2017-12-24 01:00,"Less than 85% could result in uncertainty with regard to the outcome of invalid blocks being mined, especially with the fluctuating disparity of economic activity across nodes."
3764,2017-12-24 01:00,200k nodes is enough if there are only 235k bitcoin owners...
3765,2017-12-24 01:00,"Hard to tell exactly. We're around ~150k full nodes, and probably much more than 200k bitcoin owners, so the situation is pretty bad. :/"
3766,2017-12-24 01:00,1) The maximum time everyday users are willing to wait to begin using Bitcoin. 2) Probably not for Bitcoin.
3767,2017-12-24 01:00,That's one possible option. Maybe NFC pairing or something to make it super-simple.
3768,2017-12-24 00:00,"No, they're not."
3769,2017-12-24 00:00,"Increasing block size doesn't lower fees, merely harms Bitcoin's decentralisation."
3770,2017-12-24 00:00,"Node decentralisation: A minimum of at least 85% of economic activity using bitcoins should have the receiving end using their very own full node to verify the payment has confirmed. Mining decentralisation: No more than 10% controlled by a single entity, and 30% within a nation"
3771,2017-12-24 00:00,Not if technology improves faster than the blockchain grows.
3772,2017-12-24 00:00,Merchants can use PayPal if they want something centralised. No reason to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.
3773,2017-12-24 00:00,"Nobody is trying to attack"" is no substitute for real security."""
3774,2017-12-24 00:00,Because POS is broken garbage that isn't secure in practice.
3775,2017-12-24 00:00,"Dunno about zcash, but you can already run a full node on Android devices: https:// play.google.com/store/apps/det ails?id=com.greenaddress.abcore …"
3776,2017-12-24 00:00,"Its functionality depends on its decentralisation. Otherwise, you'd be better off with PayPal."
3777,2017-12-24 00:00,"With sufficiently smaller blocks, technology could improve at a faster pace than the blockchain grows."
3778,2017-12-24 00:00,It would require a rather complicated softfork that nobody's managed to get reasonably performant yet.
3779,2017-12-24 00:00,"Sure, just use Bitcoin Knots or Core for your wallet. Simple, easy, and just works. (If you need it to use less than 200 GB of disk space, pick Knots and enable pruning when you set it up.)"
3780,2017-12-24 00:00,"So you're afraid that someone might compromise your security, and therefore to avoid that, you choose to not have any security???"
3781,2017-12-24 00:00,That's 18 months better than what we have if we do nothing. ;)
3782,2017-12-24 00:00,"Just the smart contracts for everyone, that secure the behind-the-scenes transaction volume invisible to you."
3783,2017-12-24 00:00,It's also not secure. Consensus rules are only rules if they're enforced. But trusting it means you're not enforcing it.
3784,2017-12-23 21:00,What makes you think it's detectable?
3785,2017-12-23 21:00,That's pretty much already the case with Bitcoin mining today though.
3786,2017-12-23 21:00,Wouldn't that also put any small miner out of operation since he can't finance the runtime until a return is made?
3787,2017-12-23 21:00,"But that doesn't hold up. Early on, one of the iterations of Eligius had insanely bad luck for quite a long time, but at the end of the day, it didn't matter."
3788,2017-12-23 20:00,Anything can be artificially made cheap when nobody cares to use it.
3789,2017-12-23 20:00,Does it work when you assume the users in question are willing to blindly trust the host to handle everything including funds (as is typically already the case with pooled and hosted mining today)?
3790,2017-12-23 20:00,"No, because if you can't pool mine, those people will just resort to hosted mining instead. And hosted mining is much worse. (Pooling isn't actually a problem in the first place; merely the current implementation of it is.)"
3791,2017-12-23 20:00,"That specific proposal wouldn't work at all: verification would be too expensive to even consider it a PoW algorithm. (And although the general idea might be useful, it wouldn't incentivise full nodes.)"
3792,2017-12-23 20:00,"While I do think better node diversity would be a good thing, I consider it much less of an issue than the fact that too many people aren't running full nodes at all."
3793,2017-12-23 20:00,"That only stops pools, not hosted mining."
3794,2017-12-23 20:00,"The only way to prove that, is to sync from genesis up to that height."
3795,2017-12-23 20:00,"The topic is itself a waste of time, so why should I need to argue it?"
3796,2017-12-23 20:00,"If you want more, find them yourself... https://www. reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comm ents/48bq35/increase_default_block_max_size_to_1mb/d0j8txc/ …"
3797,2017-12-23 20:00,No such thing exists...
3798,2017-12-23 20:00,You're wrong.
3799,2017-12-23 20:00,Not without a reduction of security. And the network's overall security depends on the collective security of its users...
3800,2017-12-23 20:00,No. Nodes are mostly only useful if the person who runs the node uses it for his wallet. Multiple nodes per person generally is a waste (although one at home + one at work or similar can make sense).
3801,2017-12-23 20:00,"The current block size limit is 6-9 *times* a maximum safe size. Even the 1 MB block size is 3 times. The math isn't linear, so if we hold it long enough, we'll eventually hit a cross-over point, but it's kinda scary to look at the numbers for how bad it will get first."
3802,2017-12-23 20:00,"Reducing the limit, maybe not. But reducing the actual sizes of blocks, certainly."
3803,2017-12-23 20:00,Everyone who expects to receive bitcoins should be running his own full node. It doesn't need to be 24/7. It doesn't need to be listening/public. Pruning is fine.
3804,2017-12-23 20:00,"Not sure what you're asking. VPS are of little value for a full node, since the VPS is under someone else's control."
3805,2017-12-23 20:00,"Keep in mind that once we get past the critical danger, the people who need to start nodes are the ones just *beginning* to use Bitcoin, and have no bitcoins or profit therefrom."
3806,2017-12-23 19:00,Lightning
3807,2017-12-23 19:00,How do you know the storage is in fact secure?
3808,2017-12-23 19:00,No...
3809,2017-12-23 19:00,"Depends on the infrastructure being used for the transfer. And even the traditional banks often have a per-transaction fee on top of the percentage. Note that Lightning will be closed to traditional bank transfer fees, in terms of a fixed cost plus a percent."
3810,2017-12-23 19:00,What do you mean? Lightning inherently aggregates itself.
3811,2017-12-23 19:00,Because he's an idiot and wasting my time.
3812,2017-12-23 19:00,"Nodes always need to sync full history. But that only requires big servers store it for downloading from. Since the nodes verify it themselves, no need to concern over security of the storage itself."
3813,2017-12-23 19:00,"We shouldn't, at least long-term. All smart contracts can be abbreviated as <long list of conditions> OR <both parties agree>"". Lightning can handle at least the latter case. So the blockchain basically becomes a court system for resolving disputes/fraud."""
3814,2017-12-23 19:00,"No, you don't. Go read the whitepaper and the Bitcoin v0.1 source code."
3815,2017-12-23 19:00,Because storage was never a problem in the first place?
3816,2017-12-23 19:00,"No, but each transaction depends on the validity and monitoring of the smart contracts on the blockchain."
3817,2017-12-23 19:00,"Worse still, even if you can somehow prove all invalid blocks, it's still not enough; because an attacker can make valid blocks, but withhold a single transaction to prevent full nodes from accepting them. So we'd also need proof of most-nodes-don't-know-it""."""
3818,2017-12-23 19:00,"The idea for SPV security was that full nodes would generate and broadcast fraud proofs, so that SPV nodes could know which blocks are invalid and therefore to be ignored regardless of PoW. The problem is, invalid blocks can be malformed such that they can't be proven invalid."
3819,2017-12-23 19:00,I don't know. Hopefully soon.
3820,2017-12-23 19:00,"Storage was never a bottleneck in the first place, since you can just enable pruning. When it comes to CPU time and bandwidth, the blockchain size growth (ie, block size; ~70%/year) is significantly outpacing improvements (which are only 17%/year historically)."
3821,2017-12-23 19:00,"Nothing is fully centralisation-proof, but Lightning is centralisation-resistant more than the current network is. People keeping bitcoins on exchanges is ALREADY a problem."
3822,2017-12-23 19:00,You don't understand Bitcoin at all...
3823,2017-12-23 19:00,You are wrong.
3824,2017-12-23 19:00,I hope it's eventually completely invisible to the end user.
3825,2017-12-23 19:00,"I think at least in theory, multisig ought to be possible, but I'm not sure if the Lightning standards support it."
3826,2017-12-23 19:00,"TBD. I'm not defeatist, though, just realist. I can support a PoW change, while still admitting that we don't have consensus for it."
3827,2017-12-23 19:00,"Technology historically improves at a rate of about 17% per year, so if the blockchain grows slower than that, there is a chance of improvement to the net time/cost required."
3828,2017-12-23 19:00,That reduces your security to trusting whoever did the pre-loading.
3829,2017-12-23 19:00,Verifying the blockchain is part of verifying the actual (Lightning) transactions.
3830,2017-12-23 19:00,FUD
3831,2017-12-23 19:00,I didn't.
3832,2017-12-23 19:00,Free markets actually favour centralisation...
3833,2017-12-23 19:00,"There's over 150000 nodes right now, and for Bitcoin to be secure, most people receiving bitcoins need to be running their own; so MANY more are required. If 10 million people are using bitcoins, then we should have at least 8 million people using Bitcoin (running full nodes)"
3834,2017-12-23 19:00,"Using Segwit enables larger blocks, which is harmful."
3835,2017-12-23 19:00,"Lightning is centralisation-resistant. Decreasing the block size can reduce or even reverse the ever-growing sync time required to start a full node (ie, to start using Bitcoin for real)."
3836,2017-12-23 19:00,You realize that's pure FUD? We don't even get the fees! And Blockstream doesn't own or profit from LN either.
3837,2017-12-23 18:00,"Without decentralisation, you lose those too."
3838,2017-12-23 18:00,Using Segwit enables larger blocks.
3839,2017-12-23 18:00,"Pretty much. Lightning is just another layer of Bitcoin, after all."
3840,2017-12-23 18:00,"Think of the on-chain fees as a subscription fee. It's still much less than if we tried to push everything on-chain. A block size decrease won't likely increase fees much, especially if Lightning is in production first."
3841,2017-12-23 18:00,"Defeats the purpose, since such a node is based on trusted state, not secure."
3842,2017-12-23 18:00,"Sure, there's lots of options out there. SHA3, BLAKE2, etc"

3845,2017-12-23 17:00,"That would certainly help on the mining side, but it doesn't seem like the community is going to allow it, and without unanimous consensus, it isn't possible."
3846,2017-12-23 17:00,"It doesn't create incentives to make giant hubs"". Lightning is in fact hub-resistant, since it requires anyone acting as a hub to commit 200% reserves."""
3847,2017-12-23 17:00,"The initial synchronisation time, which grows unbounded so long as blocks are larger than ~300k."
3848,2017-12-23 17:00,"Run your own full node, and use it for your wallet. For now, don't use Segwit. When Lightning becomes available, upgrade."
3849,2017-12-23 17:00,It is whatever the technology enables us to make it.
3850,2017-12-23 17:00,The nodes mainly.
3851,2017-12-23 16:00,Which is a reduction of magnitudes from what it would cost to do those same transactions all on-chain.
3852,2017-12-23 16:00,The initial sync is just going to get worse and worse until the block size is reduced.
3853,2017-12-23 16:00,How will you prevent it from becoming centralised? What stops the same things from happening to it that happen to Bitcoin?
3854,2017-12-23 16:00,... 1/100th of the cost isn't good enough because it's non-zero? Think about what you're saying.
3855,2017-12-23 16:00,"It's not the number of nodes, but percentage of all usage, that matters. Right now, it's dangerously low."
3856,2017-12-23 16:00,"It's not detectable if you run a full node. But it's already incentivised: you get to use a secure decentralised currency. Without your own full node, you're just trusting someone else at random as if they were PayPal."
3857,2017-12-23 16:00,Segwit does not decrease the size of transactions. That's a myth. Lightning is the method of reducing block sizes (and also fees) that I had in mind.
3858,2017-12-23 16:00,"The easiest way is to simply install Bitcoin Knots or Core, and use the built-in wallet to receive your bitcoin payments. (There are ways to use other wallets as well, but I'm not sure if there are any simple guides for setting that up.)"
3859,2017-12-23 16:00,"Less space used for your transactions = less fees, even if fee/byte gets high."
3860,2017-12-23 16:00,Reducing the block size will thankfully reduce transaction fees too.
3861,2017-12-23 16:00,Are you using it to confirm that your wallet is receiving bitcoins?
3862,2017-12-23 16:00,"Bitcoin has never had an unlimited block size. Satoshi's plan for that was true SPV, but true SPV turned out to be impossible."
3863,2017-12-23 16:00,Reducing the block size is a pretty important part. Backward syncing would probably be helpful. Making it easier for users to run mobile wallets using their full node at home. Education of users in general.
3864,2017-12-23 16:00,"There are dangerously few full nodes (probably a minority of the economic activity using their own), mining relies on a centralised (and censorable) backbone, majority hashrate is in a single nation's jurisdiction, etc."
3865,2017-12-23 16:00,"We don't need to *preserve* Bitcoin's decentralization. It's already lost. What we need is to *restore* that decentralisation we've lost, before it's too late and gone forever."
3866,2017-12-23 16:00,The current state is basically broken already. That's why we need to act to recover decentralisation before all hope is lost.
3867,2017-12-23 15:00,Like reducing the block size?
3868,2017-12-23 15:00,They'll find out the hard way.
3869,2017-12-23 15:00,1 MB blocks are *already* breaking the decentralization model!
3870,2017-12-23 15:00,I wouldn't want to be in a fight unless I had an advantage...
3871,2017-12-23 15:00,"That's not true. It was increased to 1 MB in 2013, and increased to 2-4 MB in 2017."
3872,2017-12-23 15:00,This is too ambiguous. What kind of fight? Am I allowed to use a gun? (That's how I'd normally handle someone trying to fight me physically.)
3873,2017-12-23 15:00,You're making things up now.
3874,2017-12-23 13:00,"Despite their illogical idiocy"", Bitcoin still sees far more adoption than it is ready for. We have no need to cater."""
3875,2017-12-23 13:00,"Many sensible people are against any increase, considering that ample evidence shows that even 1 MB is too large."
3876,2017-12-23 13:00,No. Logic is all that matters.
3877,2017-12-23 13:00,"The legitimate issues are blocks being too big, not them being too small."
3878,2017-12-23 13:00,I don't see how it could ever hope to do anything useful.
3879,2017-12-23 13:00,You're missing the point that even 1 MB blocks have been having that effect already. We have concrete evidence that a block size reduction is needed.
3880,2017-12-23 12:00,"Nothing is more important than decentralisation, because without decentralisation, we have nothing better than the Fed or PayPal."
3881,2017-12-23 12:00,"It's more important that we keep it usable for people. And with even 1 MB blocks, many people are finding the sync time way too long."
3882,2017-12-23 12:00,Suffering? Larger blocks is suffering. Smaller is good. I (and others) intentionally don't use Segwit specifically to avoid larger blocks.
3883,2017-12-23 11:00,"Bitcoin already allows 2 MB blocks, so that's not an increase at all."
3884,2017-12-23 11:00,Not sure what you're talking about?
3885,2017-12-23 11:00,Do you know if this was before or after the eucharistic miracle in his presence?
3886,2017-12-23 08:00,I don't get it.
3887,2017-12-22 22:00,A bit was first 1/8th of a US dollar. $125k / 1000000 = $0.125 = 1 USD bit.
3888,2017-12-22 22:00,"Bitcoin simply isn't ready for mainstream yet. It's an unfortunately reality. Before we get to that point, it needs to be simple and obvious to everyone that they need to run a full node (maybe they won't know that's what they're doing)."
3889,2017-12-22 21:00,"Without a full node, you are not secure, and you contribute to the network as a whole being insecure. You need a Bitcoin full node to be secure using Lightning as well."
3890,2017-12-22 21:00,"At $125k/BTC, we'll have bits parity... 1 USD bit = 1 Bitcoin bit."
3891,2017-12-22 16:00,That needs to change if we want Bitcoin to become secure.
3892,2017-12-22 16:00,"Bitcoin only works at all if most people use a full node of their own. Without that, it's worse than PayPal."
3893,2017-12-22 16:00,Except I really wasn't wrong.
3894,2017-12-22 15:00,"The block size limit is a limit, not a deterrent. 1 MB was quite successfully limiting spam until the block size was increased."
3895,2017-12-22 15:00,"No. 4-8 MB blocks would be absolutely insane. Even 1 MB blocks are doing a ton of damage, and we haven't even seen just how bad 2 MB (the current effective limit) will be."
3896,2017-12-22 15:00,"Indeed. If centralisation gets any worse, Bitcoin becomes no different from the Fed."
3897,2017-12-22 14:00,"At this point, identifying spam is more effort than it's worth (since the spam can just change again to hide). Why do you think we need something more concrete?"
3898,2017-12-22 14:00,"I'm not a security expert, but if you were concerned with that aspect, I'd offline the system entirely. Maybe there's benefits to the middle-ground, though - I'm not sure."
3899,2017-12-22 14:00,Increasing the block size would almost certainly kill Bitcoin/cryptocurrency permanently. I'm not fighting with the BCH guys. They're free to pursue their own path.
3900,2017-12-22 13:00,"Yes, quite positive. Even if we had reached 1 MB of legit transactions, the rising fees would have outpriced the low-value transfers and moved them off-chain, reducing legitimate load below 1 MB again."
3901,2017-12-22 13:00,"Sure, just setup the firewall to only allow port 8333. (Whether this is useful or not, I am less sure of.)"
3902,2017-12-22 12:00,"Not significantly, from the block size increase. If Mr. Spammer stopped spamming at the same time because he wants to prove a point"", it might - but that's another matter."""
3903,2017-12-22 12:00,"Yes, the Windows side can access the Linux partition since it has complete control of the machine."
3904,2017-12-22 02:00,You’re the one being disingenuous.
3905,2017-12-22 01:00,Fees are set by what spammers are willing to pay. It has little to do with block size.
3906,2017-12-22 01:00,"Might as well just set the block size to 5 MB. (Miners can choose their own median fee at will.) Anyhow, you didn't read my tweet. Increasing block size won't lower fees."
3907,2017-12-22 01:00,"Not a big problem, and one that can probably only be solved by altruistic miners enabling sweeping into Lightning channels."
3908,2017-12-22 01:00,"Block size and fee aren't closely related. If spammers will pay 999 sat/B, then 1000 sat/B is necessarily the outcome. Increasing block size won't change that."
3909,2017-12-21 23:00,"Nodes don't need to run 24/7, just when you receive a transaction."
3910,2017-12-21 23:00,"It seems to me that it would use less time to run Bitcoin Knots on your PC, than to plug in and setup dedicated hardware for the node..."

4069,2017-12-17 15:00,"That's only if the income drops slightly, which wouldn't be a problem. If the income drops substantially, ALL miners will be unprofitable without higher fees. No need for cooperation at that point, just setting fee rates they can afford to accept."
4070,2017-12-17 15:00,"Miners ultimately control the fees needed to get confirmed. If the fees are too low, miners can simply require higher."
4071,2017-12-17 15:00,What L2 solutions do you have in mind? Note that Lightning requires the blockchain...

4073,2017-12-17 14:00,"LOL? It DOESN'T do what is claimed! That's not an opinion, it's a fact."
4074,2017-12-17 14:00,Litecoin promotion is full of deceptive and outright false marketing.
4075,2017-12-17 14:00,I don't take the *most* issue with Litecoin.
4076,2017-12-17 14:00,Honeypots only do that when the attacker doesn't know it's a honeypot...
4077,2017-12-17 14:00,Testnet is sufficient. No excuse to scam people in the name of testing.

4079,2017-12-17 14:00,What matters is that nobody can stop anyone else from using it. Litecoin isn't needed.
4080,2017-12-17 14:00,"The public does the deployment, but at least in this context, merely deploying the code does nothing to assure or improve security of the code."
4081,2017-12-17 14:00,Segwit was already certain before 2X was ever a thing.
4082,2017-12-17 14:00,"Of course I can. Security is something derived from code and review, not from deployment."
4083,2017-12-17 14:00,There has been nothing new with Litecoin since it launched.
4084,2017-12-17 14:00,Everything you have said there is false.
4085,2017-12-17 14:00,"No, we got Segwit on Bitcoin because the community decided to upgrade to Segwit using a UASF to bypass malicious miners. It had nothing to do with Litecoin."
4086,2017-12-17 14:00,Scams such as Litecoin should have no value whatsoever. So they are always *over*valued when they are given any value at all.
4087,2017-12-17 14:00,"But it does. Without long-term adoption / value, cryptocurrencies are zero-sum games and function as scams redistributing money from one set of people to another."
4088,2017-12-17 14:00,"There may be a few altcoins with some valuable contribution. Whether or not those are sufficient for long-term survival, however, I have my doubts. And without long-term adoption, the altcoin itself still functions as a scam despite even good intentions."
4089,2017-12-17 14:00,That's not a fact. Not even close.
4090,2017-12-17 14:00,So now you're going from lying to blatant trolling... That's typically about the point where I block people.
4091,2017-12-17 14:00,Activation is nothing.
4092,2017-12-17 13:00,"No. Litecoin is a scam, nothing more. It doesn't help Bitcoin in any way, only hurts it."

4094,2017-12-17 13:00,Which is complete nonsense.
4095,2017-12-17 13:00,Litecoin has never done anything for Bitcoin.

4100,2017-12-17 13:00,"It's a lie to claim Bitcoin has followed in Litecoin's footsteps. Segwit etc are Bitcoin inventions, not Litecoin's. Litecoin merely copied them."
4101,2017-12-17 13:00,I refuse to agree to disagree. You are simply wrong.
4102,2017-12-17 13:00,Copying someone else's work doesn't mean they are affiliated with you.
4103,2017-12-17 13:00,"No, it is simply FACT to say that. Coloured coins were invented for Bitcoin, BTW."

4561,2017-11-24 17:00,It's also in your best interest to not have the blockchain grow 100+ GB every year. Using Segwit enables that. Avoiding Segwit holds it back to a slightly more reasonable rate of growth.
4562,2017-11-24 17:00,Open source doesn't set release dates. It's ready when it's ready. And why hold back other smart contracts just to wait for Lightning? There's not much point in delaying Segwit.
4563,2017-11-24 16:00,How is it a disaster?

4569,2017-11-24 14:00,"Your premise is false. There can indeed be laws without threats. The reason for prescribing a specific punishment for violation, is to avoid arbitrariness when someone commits such a crime."
4570,2017-11-24 13:00,Legitimate authority is that which is delegated by God.
4571,2017-11-24 13:00,God has obliged you to consensually GIVE some portion of your property to the State for its uses.

4609,2017-11-23 19:00,"The minimal violation would be to break the new softfork rule directly. BCH went much further than this, changing even more fundamental rules."
4610,2017-11-23 19:00,Also note that miners can perform such a chain split attack with or without a softfork! So there is no excuse to blame the softfork for the miners choosing to attack the network.
4611,2017-11-23 19:00,"Miners don't decide protocol changes. If miners fail to comply with the new rules, they are attempting a contentious hardfork, and *that* can cause a chain split. But so long as miners don't attack the network this way, there is no chain split from the softfork itself."

4663,2017-11-21 18:00,"Talos is simply the only sure way to get a non-backdoored high-end PC these days. Since the full node is part of your Bitcoin security, a secure computer to run it is ideal. Depending on your Bitcoin use, however, you might not care too much about Intel or the NSA backdoors."
4664,2017-11-21 17:00,"Ideally, a Talos 2 ( https:// raptorcs.com/TALOSII/ ). Second-best, an Intel machine with ME cleaner [hopefully] neutering the backdoor. If you are patient, ARM might be a viable option as well. Obviously you would be best avoiding backdoored OSs (Windows/macOS)."

4671,2017-11-21 16:00,"No, I paid for a working drive. That obligation remains until they ship a working drive (or at least refund me). What I do to the items I didn't order (defective drive) is irrelevant. ;)"
4672,2017-11-21 16:00,"I calculate 104 years. But it was for backups, for blockchains."
4673,2017-11-21 16:00,"Regulatory-ily speaking, you're not obliged to return products you didn't order, and they are obliged to deliver the product I did order. So it actually makes sense that they ought to replace the drive even if I don't ship them back the defective one at all."
4674,2017-11-21 16:00,They will usually allow you to destroy the drive yourself if it contains sensitive data.
4675,2017-11-21 16:00,Standard best practices. And what I paid for was a working drive. Arguably I could probably dispute the charge on grounds they didn't deliver.

4681,2017-11-21 15:00,If only I'd noticed the issue a few minutes sooner... The backup had only just barely copied the wallets to it. :/
4682,2017-11-21 15:00,"Yes (it also came with a $25 coupon for photo prints, which I can make good use of since my wife likes printed photos)."
4683,2017-11-21 15:00,Forced in the sense that Core rejects alternative policies. Limiting by weight can't reliably produce blocks of a desirable size.
4684,2017-11-21 15:00,"It was within the 15 day return window. But yes, WD has more reasonable policies, so I'm not actually taking a loss here in practice. (Doesn't justify BestBuy's bad policies, though.)"

4689,2017-11-21 15:00,"2017, when basically everyone else understands the need to protect sensitive information and lets you destroy the drive yourself."
4690,2017-11-21 15:00,Apparently @BestBuy will not let you self-destroy defective drives with sensitive information and still get a replacement... something to keep in mind when buying hard drives. (Note that deletion and formatting are NOT sufficient to protect your wallet!)

5217,2017-11-10 04:00,"Fine, but if the free market of mining manufacturers centralises mining, then the free market of Bitcoin users will make their hardware worthless. It works both ways."
5218,2017-11-10 04:00,"You just lost my interest. If mainnet isn't secure, nothing is."
5219,2017-11-10 04:00,China currently has much more than 30% under its control.
5220,2017-11-10 04:00,"Whether nodes are listening or not is unimportant. 6000 is more than enough listening. Total nodes are around 130k. Not great, but not totally terrible either. A working level 2 will reduce ongoing damage to level 1."
5221,2017-11-10 03:00,Who said anything about sidechains?
5222,2017-11-10 03:00,Reality shows they de facto *don't* have a hard time selling at unprofitable prices.
5223,2017-11-10 03:00,That's a can of worms. How do you compare two different valid chains?
5224,2017-11-10 03:00,Anything more than 30% under control of one nation's citizens should be terrifying. We should aim to never have any entity in control of more than 10%. Domestic mining at 30% doesn't accomplish this.
5225,2017-11-10 01:00,Even just the mining aspect being centralised is deadly to Bitcoin.
5226,2017-11-10 01:00,"Because if you don't sell them, you'll centralise the network and the community will make them worthless with a PoW change."
5227,2017-11-10 01:00,"Sure, so long as they don't mine themselves, and sell fairly (no bulk discounts to industrial mines)."
5228,2017-11-10 01:00,"Miners AREN'T decentralised, though."
5229,2017-11-10 01:00,As soon as we have consensus. (When to activate is another matter to be considered; there doesn't seem to be an obvious perfect answer there.)
5230,2017-11-10 01:00,It's not retaliation. It's defense against centralisation.

5234,2017-11-10 01:00,"Ideally, people shouldn't blindly trust devs either. Check the facts and arguments, hire someone who can read code to review that too. Sadly, most people can't review code, and I'm not sure if there's a good solution to that."
5235,2017-11-10 01:00,"Building new ASICs takes time, and we can just change again if they re-centralise."
5236,2017-11-09 14:00,"Unfortunately, I don't think we have consensus on that yet."
5237,2017-11-09 12:00,"At the very least, ASICs for them aren't monopolised at this time."
5238,2017-11-09 11:00,We DO see miners trying to break rules. That's EXACTLY what 2X was.
5239,2017-11-09 10:00,Unsolicited scamcoin promotion = I block you.
5240,2017-11-09 10:00,If Bitmain liquidates maybe.
5241,2017-11-09 10:00,"I passed on Eligius to wizkid057's capable management years ago. But growing smaller pools in general is still a good idea, yes."
5242,2017-11-09 10:00,"Right now, there are only a few miners who make up a majority of the hashrate. Acceptable numbers would be less than 30% controlled by entities subject to a given jurisdiction, and no more than 10% controlled by a single entity."
5243,2017-11-09 10:00,"Except SHA256 isn't random. It's assigned by Bitmain. To get random, we need to change PoW."
5244,2017-11-09 10:00,So why have proof-of-work at all? We could just pick Alice and Bob and let them mine without expending energy. The block reward will still incentivise them to act economically rational.
5245,2017-11-09 10:00,That won't happen while Bitmain has a monopoly and can put 10 Th/s of their own online using the profits of every 1 Th/s they sell to someone else.
5246,2017-11-09 10:00,The math says Bitcoin is vulnerable when mining is centralised.
5247,2017-11-09 10:00,"The miners have incentive to avoid breaking Bitcoin, so we should trust them."" begs the question- why use proof-of-work at all rather than just assign the miners? (Reason is to avoid a need for trusting miners!)"""
5248,2017-11-09 09:00,"Mining pools aren't necessarily a point of centralisation (see p2pool and GBT). But in any case, the worse alternative of insecure cloud mining cannot be prevented, so there's little value blocking even centralised pool mining."
5249,2017-11-09 08:00,"Definitely false, considering they've had YEARS of warning now. PoW change conditions were met a long time ago, and are now overdue."
5250,2017-11-09 08:00,It's like saying you won't make SATA hard drives because PATA hard drives are obsolete. XD
5251,2017-11-09 07:00,That's unrelated positive or negative with a PoW change.
5252,2017-11-09 07:00,Then almost every business will lose $$$ until we end up with only non-malicious businesses left. Good outcome.
5253,2017-11-09 07:00,"And? So long as the future manufacturers don't abuse their position, they have nothing to worry about."
5254,2017-11-09 07:00,"Welcome to 2017, where that has been proven wrong at least in practice."
5255,2017-11-09 07:00,Then all they need to do is not abuse their position. Not rocket science.
5256,2017-11-09 04:00,"Maybe. I also wonder if the BLAKE variants are similar enough such that we could support all of them - then manufacturers could choose different targets, and we could softfork disable only the ones implemented by malicious miners..."
5257,2017-11-09 02:00,"Hopefully whoever makes ASICs for the next PoW algorithm won't abuse their position, and no further changes will be needed."
5258,2017-11-09 02:00,"There does need to be consensus, but it's a disaster that newbies were not educated on the necessity of doing it when mining centralised."
5259,2017-11-09 02:00,PoW changes were on the table before SHA2 ASICs were ever on the market. The understanding that we'd change PoW algorithm if it resulted in centralised mining was there from the start. Bankrupting corrupt chip firms that ignored this warning and abused their position is GOOD.
5260,2017-11-09 01:00,"No, it would only disincentive them from abusing their position."
5261,2017-11-09 01:00,"I don't see a proof-of-memory here. You're doing hashing, which isn't done by memory. You also lack cheap verification and progress-free, both critical attributes for a PoW algorithm. Finally, since you throw away the previous hash when done with it, I can just reuse that memory."
5262,2017-11-09 01:00,I can only guess... (not thinking about whether their profit is from valuation increases rather than mining; indirect money laundry; getting someone else to pay the expenses; at least some altruistic; etc)
5263,2017-11-09 00:00,"An inefficient SHA256d is simple. Actually producing a *competitive* chip is complicated, due to weaknesses found after Bitcoin launched. What back end? You mean the open source mining software myself and others have written without pay from the manufacturers?"
5264,2017-11-09 00:00,"You could make an ASIC to work with any of the changed"" algorithms..."""
5265,2017-11-09 00:00,"Those chips are already unprofitable to run, except for Bitmain (which we shouldn't care about at this point)."
5266,2017-11-08 22:00,That changed with the advent of ASICBoost - and even to a lesser degree with other optimisations - which made the ideal SHA2 ASIC complicated to implement.
5267,2017-11-08 21:00,Huh? You have that backward. The early days of ASIC mining were far better than now.
5268,2017-11-08 21:00,They already have a utility guarantee in the form of BCH. (It'd be good for BCH too!)
5269,2017-11-08 21:00,"Boring"" seems too boring a word for it. XD"""
5270,2017-11-08 21:00,They wouldn't need to go that far. Most people can probably be bribed to quit for cheaper than an assassination of them.
5271,2017-11-08 13:00,It shouldn't be a last resort.
5272,2017-11-08 13:00,"No, it didn't, actually."
5273,2017-11-08 10:00,"No, you're redefining Bitcoin now. Read the source code."
5274,2017-11-08 10:00,"There is no 1 or 2 in the code. Blocks can be up to 4 MB now. PoW is NOT any more fundamental than the block size limit, not at all. The limit is STILL needed to limit spam these days; more than it was in the early days, in fact."
5275,2017-11-08 10:00,But those farms wouldn't have an advantage over everyone else. ;)
5276,2017-11-08 10:00,"In layman's terms, the Bitcoin network today is insecure, and relies on trusting Bitmain. Changing PoW can make it secure again."
5277,2017-11-08 10:00,"It's needed because Bitmain has broken and monopolised the SHA2 PoW, turning it into an assigned-by-Bitmain more than proof-of-work. Changing it gets us back to real proof-of-work, and hopefully it will stay decentralised."

5281,2017-11-08 09:00,It's not possible to keep it secret.
5282,2017-11-08 09:00,"No, it doesn't mean that. Changing PoW is exactly the same as changing the block size limit."
5283,2017-11-08 09:00,"They're talking about attacking, not merely leaving. And miner defection to an alltcoin has nothing to do with Nakamoto consensus anyway."
5284,2017-11-08 08:00,Certainly can't do worse than SHA2 is.
5285,2017-11-08 08:00,Changing the PoW as planned in 2012 isn't defeat..
5286,2017-11-08 08:00,A mixture gets you the worst attributes of both.
5287,2017-11-08 08:00,ASIC-resistant is generally a bad thing.
5288,2017-11-08 08:00,So many reasons this is a bad idea...

5290,2017-11-08 08:00,And when Bitcoin doesn't work because the SHA2 issuer attacks?
5291,2017-11-08 08:00,Multi-algo is a can of worms.
5292,2017-11-08 06:00,"IMO we should try for a simple-to-ASIC PoW algorithm like SHA3, Keccak, or a BLAKE variant. But despite my reservations, I'm also willing to consider trying a well-tested memory-hard"" PoW algorithm if the community prefers that direction."""

5296,2017-11-08 04:00,Bitmain says they're voluntarily leaving. So all we need to do is change PoW and presumably they won't follow.

5300,2017-11-08 04:00,"Existing hash power has already chosen 2X, but no: they have a choice between 2X, BCH, or even Freicoin or minor alts. It won't weaken the network, because SHA2 is broken as a PoW algorithm, so *any* PoW change is automatically an improvement to security."
5301,2017-11-08 04:00,"SHA2 wasn't known to be weak until Bitcoin incentivised breaking it. The only way we're going to find a strong PoW algorithm, is trial and error. And changing when an algorithm get centralised also disincentivises centralisation."
5302,2017-11-08 04:00,"Extreme uptick? The plan to change PoW algorithm in these circumstances was established in 2012, before any mass-production ASICs were available! Those criteria were met over a year ago. There is no reason for current miners to expect the algorithm to NOT change ASAP."
5303,2017-11-08 03:00,Not sure what you mean. SHA2 has not achieved the goal.
5304,2017-11-08 03:00,"That doesn't make any sense, and sat is inherently centralised."

5311,2017-11-08 03:00,"ASIC resistance is exactly what gives the first ASIC a huge advantage. Using an ASIC-friendly algorithm minimises it, and makes it less likely the first will be first for very long."

5559,2017-10-28 21:00,"No, it isn't a hardfork. Hardforks don't result in two chains. BCH is a premined altcoin."
5560,2017-10-28 21:00,"Miners don't decide protocol changes. If not for Litecoin, we could have taken more time on UASF."
5561,2017-10-28 21:00,"Yes, it is."
5562,2017-10-28 21:00,Roger is lying through his teeth.
5563,2017-10-28 21:00,I call BCH an altcoin because that's what it is. It isn't Bitcoin.
5564,2017-10-28 21:00,"No, it isn't (to both questions)."
5565,2017-10-28 21:00,Why is one distribution method better than another?
5566,2017-10-28 21:00,"No, I don't. BCH isn't the original angle. The original plan proved to be impossible."
5567,2017-10-28 21:00,Litecoin/Charlie didn't invent scrypt mining. ArtForz did that. Charlie just copied it.
5568,2017-10-28 13:00,Because proof-of-stake doesn't work (yet?).

5585,2017-10-27 05:00,"Read your own tweets. 95% is technically insufficient. It's not a decision someone makes, it's a technical requirement."
5586,2017-10-27 05:00,"No, it isn't detectable in code, because miners can make blocks at any time retroactively. Also, 100 blocks per 2 weeks isn't unusable."
5587,2017-10-27 05:00,"No, it isn't. Code can't even measure users."
5588,2017-10-27 05:00,"No. You can use any sane definition of the community, and a majority of it still opposes 2X."

5604,2017-10-26 15:00,It's not as bad as the alternatives?
5605,2017-10-26 15:00,False. Miner signalling was deprecated by BIP148. They had no choice.
5606,2017-10-26 14:00,Miners don't decide protocol changes. Segwit was locked in by BIP148 before 2X was ever a thing.
5607,2017-10-26 14:00,Obviously not. There isn't even a need for 1 MB blocks.

5612,2017-10-26 13:00,Read the rest of the tweets in the thread.
5613,2017-10-26 13:00,Not lying. What you said has NOTHING to do what what I just said.

5615,2017-10-26 13:00,That's a technical fact. It doesn't need agreement.
5616,2017-10-26 13:00,There isn't a short term problem. 1 MB blocks is more than enough. Bitcoin will not be in a mainstream form for years either.
5617,2017-10-26 13:00,"What nonsense is this? Those of us who partook in HKA, DID follow through with it."
5618,2017-10-26 13:00,Shorter block interval does not make confirmation faster. Now you need 24 blocks instead of 6. BCH isn't Bitcoin and is irrelevant to this.
5619,2017-10-26 13:00,A supermajority of the economy OPPOSES 2X.
5620,2017-10-26 13:00,That's my point.
5621,2017-10-26 13:00,"lol, no."

5652,2017-10-25 20:00,It is indeed 8 MB. What differentiates an altcoin from a hardfork is consensus from the entire community.

6286,2017-09-21 13:00,No. Ethereum has ONLY miners running full nodes. That's basically the same as the Fed.

6310,2017-09-19 21:00,That's no different than saying a P2SH-violating chain isn't invalid. Or that an 8 MB block chain isn't invalid.
6311,2017-09-19 21:00,Not necessarily. That would only happen if *miners* split the chain by making a longer invalid chain that your [non-full] node accepted.

6315,2017-09-19 17:00,Because it's not useful.
6316,2017-09-19 17:00,What? Of course they can. Sidechains can do literally anything that could be done in an altcoin.
6317,2017-09-19 15:00,"I know I want them to be as cheap as possible, and I expect other devs are the same. We don't even get the fees! But gotta be realistic."
6318,2017-09-19 13:00,"Miners can split the chain at any time by mining invalid blocks, with or without UASFs. UASF doesn't change this."
6319,2017-09-19 13:00,UASF doesn't split the chain.
6320,2017-09-19 12:00,UASF wasn't/isn't a threat.
6321,2017-09-19 12:00,"No, a majority of the community supported BIP148, and if the blindly-follow-Core group was onboard, it would have matched Segwit support."
6322,2017-09-19 12:00,That's a lie.
6323,2017-09-19 12:00,"Yes, on-chain. (Although your dismissal of other Bitcoin layers is ridiculous.)"
6324,2017-09-19 11:00,There wouldn't even BE a legacy chain unless miners performed a chain-split attack. Note this is the same as with any softfork.
6325,2017-09-19 11:00,"Without mandatory signalling, there is uncertainty around what the chain rules are, and light clients cannot make a decision on which rules."
6326,2017-09-19 11:00,But nobody was objecting to it on those grounds.
6327,2017-09-19 11:00,Probably around half of all softforks were contentious. Not tolerating contentious softforks would probably mean no more softforks ever.
6328,2017-09-19 11:00,"I agree, but people are trying to spread misinformation to make it sound like Core opposed it."
6329,2017-09-19 11:00,All future softforks should be like BIP148.
6330,2017-09-19 10:00,Contentious changes are fine if have sufficient support and do no harm to those who don't opt to use them. Segwit itself was contentious.
6331,2017-09-19 10:00,It's just the truth.
6332,2017-09-19 10:00,"And even without that 20%, the other 60% who made an informed decision to support BIP148 was sufficient for its success."
6333,2017-09-19 10:00,"The ONLY significant hold-backs for BIP148, were people blindly following Core to make the decisions for them."
6334,2017-09-19 10:00,Bitcoin has supported smart contracts since 2009.
6335,2017-09-19 10:00,It's not a false narrative. Almost all the categories on the page are supportive of BIP148.
6336,2017-09-19 10:00,Please don't quote me out of context.
6337,2017-09-19 10:00,"Of course, because it is."
6338,2017-09-19 10:00,"No, it wasn't. UASF was in the spirit of how Bitcoin is intended to work. 2X is a complete violation of that."
6339,2017-09-19 10:00,You mean a chain split. That's not a HF...
6340,2017-09-19 00:00,Matt and Morcos were part of the non-supportive minority. Majority of devs supported BIP148.
6341,2017-09-18 22:00,Context matters. UASF didn't cause a chain split. BCH is just an unrelated altcoin - nothing to do with UASF.
6342,2017-09-18 20:00,"You're assuming some altcoin can do better faster. The last 8 years shows that altcoins do nothing but copy, while innovation is on Bitcoin."
6343,2017-09-18 19:00,"No, it didn't. BIP148 had widespread support, and most devs supported it. Just not ALL devs, because a few were too pessimistic."
6344,2017-09-18 19:00,It had a different limit (database locks) that made even 1 MB blocks impossible.
6345,2017-09-18 19:00,Because anything larger is unsustainable (at least for now).
6346,2017-09-18 17:00,Except your soft fork doesn't have widespread user support. It's also unclear whether it harms those who don't want it.
6347,2017-09-18 17:00,The uncensored ones have more readers anyway.
6348,2017-09-18 17:00,"No, it wasn't. Besides (really) scaling, there is also the huge issues of user experience/interface, and security."
6349,2017-09-18 16:00,Existing rules included BIP148.
6350,2017-09-18 16:00,Neither chain is traded at that price...?
6351,2017-09-18 16:00,You don't get it.

6353,2017-09-18 16:00,"Just to be clear, which chain is it?"
6354,2017-09-18 16:00,"Not increasing it would have probably been better, though."
6355,2017-09-18 16:00,Same here. Who doesn't consider ETC the real Eth?
6356,2017-09-18 16:00,"93% *don't* support 2X - only 5-12%. And for a hardfork change, it needs 100% (or at least pretty close), not merely 93%."
6357,2017-09-18 16:00,"2X proposes fraud to force people to abandon Bitcoin. UASF hurt nobody, and merely improved Bitcoin."
6358,2017-09-18 16:00,People in civilized countries should expect prosecution of widespread fraud.
6359,2017-09-18 16:00,BCH already accomplished the clean(ish) split.
6360,2017-09-18 16:00,"All Bitcoin implementations treat 2X as invalid, since there is a 4M weight limit, and 2X produces invalid blocks with >4M weight."
6361,2017-09-18 16:00,"No, it's the attempted hardfork *removing* the UASF that would cause a persistent chain split. The UASF itself does not."

6363,2017-09-18 15:00,Because the users of Bitcoin don't collectively recognise it.
6364,2017-09-18 15:00,"No, Bitcoin is the consensus code/rules that the network (collective of users who run nodes) runs. Core is one implementation of that."
6365,2017-09-18 15:00,Unlikely.
6366,2017-09-18 15:00,Coinbase and other businesses will learn the hard way if they try to steal their customers' money through fraud.
6367,2017-09-18 15:00,"The whitepaper was just an overview at best. Satoshi's actual code ALWAYS enforced the rules, whether mining or not."
6368,2017-09-18 15:00,But it's also completely centralised.
6369,2017-09-18 15:00,Every softfork has a hypothetical opposing hardfork removing the new rule. But it is only the hardfork (not the softfork) which can split.
6370,2017-09-18 15:00,"Anyone can mine. If the miners go away, it gets easier for everyone else to become the new miners."
6371,2017-09-18 15:00,"If that's *all* you do, then no, you don't. Maybe you should be heard out anyway, but the reality is you're not a user in that case."
6372,2017-09-18 15:00,"Also, producing invalid blocks is ZERO hashpower as far as Bitcoin is concerned."
6373,2017-09-18 15:00,"Hashpower is miners. Miners don't decide the protocol, period. That 90% is meaningless."
6374,2017-09-18 15:00,"No, it would not. Maybe miners would have split the chain to retaliate, but that's on them. Blaming BIP148 would be a lie."

6965,2017-07-15 09:00,1/ Centralised hashpower isn't security in the first place. 2/ There is no evidence to suggest the claim BIP148 has near-zero support.
6966,2017-07-15 07:00,"Heck, even a block size hardfork might have been completed by now if things went that way. Hindsight is always clearer."
6967,2017-07-15 07:00,"Smart investors will hire someone skilled they trust to verify things. Your decision not to doesn't centralise development, in any case."
6968,2017-07-15 07:00,"They're not really honest about motives, so we can only speculate. It seems likely they want control to block privacy improvements later."
6969,2017-07-15 07:00,"And possible to make it temporary as well. Either way, it's something mostly unrelated to Segwit at this point."
6970,2017-07-15 06:00,Reducing the block weight limit would be just another softfork on top. The hard part will be establishing support for it.
6971,2017-07-15 04:00,"BIP 91 is dangerous without Segwit2x attached. It's merely the same as BIP148, but on Jihan's terms."
6972,2017-07-15 03:00,"Except your GF has no business making rules for you. Miners, on the other hand, are DEFINED by the rules the community decides on."
6973,2017-07-15 02:00,BIP148 doesn't do that. It just requires that valid blocks must have a single bit set in the header.
6974,2017-07-15 02:00,"There is no ultimatum, just a new protocol rule."
6975,2017-07-15 02:00,"No, UASF is a softfork. Softforks are never hardforks. Also, BIP148 does not split the chain."

6979,2017-07-15 01:00,(except the 2-4 MB block size increase being too big. but nobody's arguing that.)
6980,2017-07-15 01:00,"It's not a reason, it's insanity or trolling. There is no rational basis for opposing Segwit."
6981,2017-07-15 01:00,That's Segwit2x.
6982,2017-07-15 01:00,Its merits were clearly established months ago. The only reason NOT to support BIP148 at this point is politics.

6985,2017-07-15 00:00,"Segwit2x's hardfork depends on Segwit activating, so it will never activate on an anti-Segwit chain."
6986,2017-07-15 00:00,"Dunno. Either BIP148 is harmless, or it helps them. Either way, actively supporting BIP148 is in their interests."
6987,2017-07-15 00:00,"And who knows, maybe their proactive support for BIP148 will convince the community to go along with the hardfork 90 days later."
6988,2017-07-15 00:00,"Realization: Segwit2x supporters should actively support BIP148 if miners split the chain, since only the BIP148 side can lead to their HF."

6990,2017-07-14 22:00,"No, miners DO NOT control Bitcoin... unless the community allows/enables them to by blindly following the miners' fiat."
6991,2017-07-14 21:00,Nobody should control Bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to make it as hard as possible to control.
6992,2017-07-14 20:00,1/ Bitcoin Core is not centralised at all. 2/ I don't advocate giving Bitcoin Core control of Bitcoin either.
6993,2017-07-14 20:00,"If you want to just trust someone, there's no need for a blockchain at all."

6996,2017-07-14 19:00,"If you allow miners to control Bitcoin, it ceases to be a useful store of value too, since miners at the very least CAN inflate it."
6997,2017-07-14 18:00,Not if I don't get my way: if users allow miners to take-over control of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin ceases to be interesting in that case.
6998,2017-07-14 18:00,I'm not the one that would be responsible.

7101,2017-07-11 21:00,Prepare what? BIP148 began w/ 8 months lead time to activation. Now BIP149 is suggesting mere 6 months & BIP149 is a lot more complex/risky!

7104,2017-07-11 20:00,There is no reason to expect BIP149 to have any better a chance than BIP148. Nobody uses altcoins because they still have hope for Bitcoin.
7105,2017-07-11 20:00,Can does not mean will. Why should anyone bother? Miners will just reject Segwit reformulated. And miner-controlled = useless anyway.
7106,2017-07-11 20:00,"Not only is this marketing, but it creates a situation where Bitcoin's network effect is inherently less long-term."
7107,2017-07-11 20:00,"That can only go so far. Altcoins will soon have real scaling via Lightning, which will give them a significant advantage over Bitcoin."

7109,2017-07-11 19:00,"How so? What use is a miner-controlled centralised and stagnant cryptocurrency, vs something decentralised and improving?"
7110,2017-07-11 19:00,BIP148 is part of what makes a chain valid.
7111,2017-07-11 18:00,BIP148 is Bitcoin.

7115,2017-07-11 16:00,"No, BIP149 is NOT significantly less contentious within Core. There is no reason to expect it to be merged either."

7117,2017-07-11 16:00,Inventing new ways to attack does not make it any less of an attack...
7118,2017-07-11 16:00,"While BIP9 was designed such that redeployment was trivial, Segwit itself was not, and there are a lot of odd cases that need to be handled."
7119,2017-07-11 16:00,"BIP149 needs redeployment code, which is significantly more complicated than BIP148 merely activating the current deployment."
7120,2017-07-11 16:00,"In that scenario (with both BIPs), the chain splits only if 51% of miners fail to reject that invalid block."
7121,2017-07-11 16:00,"That's not correct. The situation for BIP148 and BIP149 is identical. In both cases, a miner must make an invalid block (Core never would)."
7122,2017-07-11 16:00,"Everyone's data is different, but I think I've filtered out the most common sensitive data. Just look through the text area and make sure."
7123,2017-07-11 16:00,The current BIP149 proposal is more rushed than BIP148 was. And anything sooner than 18 months from now is likely dangerous.
7124,2017-07-11 16:00,I'm one of the people disagreeing.

7140,2017-07-09 08:00,Censorship is what you get when miners are all forced to filter certain transactions on the basis of who sends/receives them.
7141,2017-07-08 21:00,The difference is that normal full nodes *don't* need to participate in the drivechain.

7148,2017-07-08 15:00,BIP91 is redundant. Miners can adopt BIP148 to do the same thing cleaner.

7152,2017-07-08 05:00,We should not see a split in Aug regardless. But miners could choose to retaliate.
7153,2017-07-08 05:00,Miners can split the chain at any time.

7155,2017-07-08 04:00,(Which I note is still strictly better than a amicable chain split - basically you can get a merge/reunion later w/ the drivechain way.)
7156,2017-07-08 04:00,"(You'd not have access to the main chain this way, but it would still work and pegging can be added later.)"
7157,2017-07-08 04:00,A drivechain can be made just as compatible as a hardfork for light wallets.

7176,2017-07-06 23:00,That assumes the old software is still upgraded to some minimum level. The same is true with BIP148 and these proposed changes.
7177,2017-07-06 21:00,Now you're incentivising miners to maliciously hold every upgrade hostage.

7179,2017-07-06 15:00,"Once the softfork is active, ignoring the new rules may have financial incentives. But signalling is pre-activation, so no such incentive."
7180,2017-07-06 15:00,Because the level of support for the former is much lower (economic incentive is entirely in favour) than the latter.
7181,2017-07-06 15:00,"You'd basically need to start the deployment over to be safe, stalling the softfork even longer."
7182,2017-07-06 15:00,"That would be a serious degradation in security, since only newly deployed nodes would enforce the rule even once activated."

7184,2017-07-06 14:00,"So after you deploy w/ If (95% signal support) { enforce new rules after 1 retarget } noelse, how do you safely add the else later on?"
7185,2017-07-06 14:00,"Without the mandatory signalling, you can't start off proposals as a MASF and make them a UASF later on. You have to commit upfront."
7186,2017-07-06 14:00,"How about the other reasons, such as the fact that it avoids having to make every single softfork a UASF?"

7188,2017-07-06 14:00,"Only risk is following an invalid chain, which is unavoidable for ANY softfork."
7189,2017-07-06 14:00,That's not true. Miners who just use Core as-is will never violate BIP148 themselves.
7190,2017-07-06 14:00,Depends on other miners. Basically miners failing to upgrade in (ANY) softfork is the equivalent to SPV mining. Very unsafe.
7191,2017-07-06 13:00,"It's just another consensus rule, like any other. Miners simply don't violate it. No invalid blocks = nothing gets orphaned""."""
7192,2017-07-06 02:00,At least one person already did that... http:// pa.xro.ca / I don't know if trustworthy or has found any blocks yet.
7193,2017-07-06 01:00,Also a nice side effect can be using the mandatory signalling to avoid unnecessary UASFs. Otherwise all softforks need UASF at the start.
7194,2017-07-06 01:00,"Otherwise you end up in a situation where nobody really knows if (eg) Segwit is active, until someone tries to steal the coins."
7195,2017-07-06 01:00,"Yes, it is, which is also why it is harmless to require it. Mandatory signalling is to have an indisputable activation for the chain."
7196,2017-07-06 01:00,Softforks have always required miners to upgrade. Concealing that fact just harms the network. Signal change is just a part of the protocol.
7197,2017-07-06 00:00,"This is ignoring the risk to the network, and the uncertainty created by neglecting to have at least temporary mandatory signalling."
7198,2017-07-06 00:00,This doesn't change the optional-ness of the softforked features. Miners can still mine non-Segwit blocks even with BIP148 for example.
7199,2017-07-06 00:00,Learn about Lightning. It's trustless and p2p.

7201,2017-07-06 00:00,"The problem isn't the hardfork, it's the block size increase. It increases requirements to use Bitcoin, more than anything else."
7202,2017-07-06 00:00,"Do you really not have any idea what is going on, or are you trolling by misrepresenting it?"
7203,2017-07-05 23:00,Doesn't something like OfficeMax just print whatever you want in poster form?
7204,2017-07-05 23:00,"That really does nothing useful for sidechains, and is fundamentally incompatible with how Bitcoin is used today."
7205,2017-07-05 23:00,Lightning is higher priority since it makes Bitcoin actually scale decently. (Lightning needs Segwit.) Drivechains are also a good idea tho.
7206,2017-07-05 23:00,Just run your miners on a BIP148 mining pool.
7207,2017-07-05 23:00,Just that: FUD.

7396,2017-06-27 14:00,Status quo isn't even an option on the table now. The only way to avoid a chain split is BIP148.
7397,2017-06-27 14:00,I'm not changing the subject. Segwit2x is a hardfork. That means 100% must upgrade for it to work. So expecting 100% upgraded is reasonable.

8569,2017-11-13 14:00,"It *does* improve scaling, but of course it was never going to solve all issues. To the best of my knowledge bitcoin has never had a hardfork, if it can be done with a softfork then why not? Unless you support asciboost lol"
8570,2017-11-13 03:00,Where exactly is the risk with SegWit? Surely you're not talking about that FUD nonsense of miners stealing all anyonecanspend outputs...
8571,2017-11-01 03:00,"I've been given the privilege to help out as mod of Bitcoin.SE alongside @murchandamus and achow101, an awesome community, very excited https:// twitter.com/StackBitcoin/s tatus/925525746109616128 …"
8572,2017-09-30 19:00,Wow. https:// twitter.com/dubstrike/stat us/913965740620963841 …
8573,2018-01-30 15:00,Because there is no point in having a bech32 address to give people to pay you if the software they are using does not yet support it. Ecosystem needs to support parsing and sending to bech32 addresses as first stage of segwit wallet adoption.
8574,2018-01-30 13:00,It will not default to bech32 (in terms of the addresses it generates for you to give out) but it will be an option.

8576,2018-01-19 05:00,Come on Ryan. Death spiral? In my opinion this would come nowhere near justifying an emergency HF. Just be a few weeks of really high fees.
8577,2018-01-15 09:00,"I don’t think anyone is saying you shouldn’t use the code, but your tweet sounded like you were trying to trade on the brand of his name, implying he supported BCH."
8578,2018-01-13 12:00,"This is an important point. Would be nice if Coinbase was a better citizen, but any resource can and will be abused, so consensus rules must limit extent of that. Large blocksize => more externalized cost. https:// twitter.com/kallewoof/stat us/952097818792968192 …"
8579,2018-01-13 09:00,Ha. It’s not mixing when Coinbase has all the records.
8580,2018-01-13 07:00,Argument against that is privacy. But should have it as an option. Most users would prefer lower fees and revealing they use Coinbase
8581,2018-01-12 21:00,Second time I’ve seen this misinformation. Lightning txs are very much validated by your own node. They just aren’t validated by everyone else’s! https:// twitter.com/justicemate/st atus/951987598515294208 …
8582,2018-01-11 06:00,"Well put! Bitcoin is a very risky “investment”. Everything else is worse. A few are just riskier, most are worthless scams. If you can’t tell the difference, steer clear. https:// twitter.com/mir_btc/status /951413321458216960 …"
8583,2018-01-09 12:00,I think the point of a nightclub DJ is to get everyone to raise their hands in the air?
8584,2018-01-06 12:00,Yeah those are even more likely to not be worth more than epsilon. See this: https:// medium.com/john-pfeffer/a n-institutional-investors-take-on-cryptoassets-690421158904?source=linkShare-6265bfec3c93-1515267874 …
8585,2018-01-06 12:00,It’s a bad analogy. Coin failure rate is likely to be 99.9-100%. Just no reason for lots of different tokens to have value.
8586,2018-01-06 12:00,"Start by leading by example. Not starting or buying or trading worthless alt coins. Work on new tech, sure, but don’t monetize everything just because some fool will give you money for it."
8587,2018-01-06 12:00,Reminds me of the day trading frenzy from 2000. The only people getting rich were the brokers. It’s just gambling. But in this case the outcome is almost certainly zero.
8588,2018-01-06 12:00,"Jeff, aren’t you aware what’s happening? Public is indiscriminately buying any new low px coin thinking they missed BTC boat, they’ll catch the next one. That’s not how it works. They’ll all lose badly. Coinbase shouldn’t be offering every altcoin"
8589,2018-01-06 11:00,You’re actually suggesting they auction listings? That is so absurdly unethical I don’t know where to start. We need to clean up this embarrassing mess of scams and snake oil our space has become.
8590,2018-01-04 08:00,"Completely serious question Roger, why do you think it’s OK for you to rebrand Bitcoin as “Bitcoin Core” but it’s not ok for people to call Bitcoin Cash something else? It’s fine if you like BCH better, but please don’t try to confuse people, there is no “Bitcoin Core”"
8591,2018-01-03 20:00,Thank you! Yes the whole section taken together I would say is an accurate representation of my views. Lightning is promising!
8592,2018-01-03 18:00,Wait. Why don’t you trust them with encrypted backups?
8593,2018-01-03 18:00,"Is that an actual quote? I do think we shouldn’t expect it to be a panacea, but that seems significantly more pessimistic than I feel. Can you point me to the time that quote is from?"
8594,2017-12-31 13:00,Theoretically. But taxes sure make it MUCH harder because you lose >50% of your gains every year. In practice way too many people don’t optimize for after tax return.
8595,2017-12-31 13:00,Real life answer: No. Nothing beats tax-deferred compounding.
8596,2017-12-27 11:00,I honestly don’t understand why some people assign such horrible motivations to an open group of collaborators. Do they think we are part of a grand conspiracy? I came from the outside and found Core open and welcoming. https:// twitter.com/truthcoin/stat us/946076451819974658 …
8597,2017-12-24 07:00,I didn’t interpret “us” the same way you did. I thought he meant broadly all the people who are working to improve Bitcoin.
8598,2017-12-23 16:00,My attempt at humor failed. I have no BCH.
8599,2017-12-23 15:00,I'll trade you all my BCH for a number of your BTC of your choosing.
8600,2017-12-20 21:00,Yes I like your take. How many dissenters you are willing to overrule is your personal choice. I’m expressing my preference for not changing if consensus size would be notably reduced.
8601,2017-12-20 20:00,That is a concern of mine.
8602,2017-12-20 20:00,Obviously it's not everyone. Each person decides for themselves how many people they are willing to overrule. We've seen in all the prior forks that different people have different tolerances. Also depends on the issue.
8603,2017-12-20 16:00,It is in the sense that if they really don’t consent then they won’t be part of your new money.
8604,2017-12-20 16:00,"Assuming you mean increasing block weight, if I ever do it’ll certainly be asking and not demanding. And I’ll respect the answer."
8605,2017-12-20 16:00,That’s how anyone should ask for any consensus change. BTC is permissionless innovation except when it comes to changing rules and then it requires everyone’s permission. https:// twitter.com/mkomaransky/st atus/943593097526693888 …
8606,2017-12-20 10:00,This is great commentary. Thanks for doing this! https:// twitter.com/neha/status/94 3521027237339136 …
8607,2017-12-20 09:00,Agreed. This is all new stuff. Experimentation is good. That's why I said long term significant value. It worries more more now though that retail investors are getting involved.
8608,2017-12-20 07:00,No reason for more than 1 coin of a given purpose to have long term value and so far it’s an open question whether any purpose other than money can be served by a coin.
8609,2017-12-20 07:00,If you can just clone Bitcoin and create value then by induction you can keep doing this and have destroyed digital scarcity that gives BTC its value.
8610,2017-12-20 07:00,I’m glad the LTC chain exists. Experimentation is good but at the end of the day there is no reason for it or countless other clones to have long term significant value.
8611,2017-12-19 21:00,The quoted chart shows a totally unrealistic price for BitcoinCash that existed momentarily on one exchanges botched trading launch. @CNBC should have a higher standard for market prices.
8612,2017-12-19 21:00,"This kind of misleading propaganda is unfortunate. Smart money isn't going to fall for BitcoinCash or AltCoin #1931, but if main stream media is helping pump those things, the individual investor at home is going to be the one losing out. https:// twitter.com/CNBCFastMoney/ status/943291821035319297 …"
8613,2017-12-16 13:00,Exactly the data I used. Maybe I made a mistake? Cleared down to 100 satoshis per byte just last night. That’s less than $5 for a normal size transaction isn’t it? And being part of a a big exchange withdrawal should make it even cheaper.
8614,2017-12-16 12:00,Pretty cheap dinner. Moving transactions off and back on exchange should not cost more than $10 round trip now or at any point in the past.
8615,2017-12-13 08:00,could you have put this link at the top?
8616,2017-12-11 13:00,"Agree people should do that and they do (see @hrdng ) But key point is it is not authoritative. Core speaks authoritatively about what their software does, but not Bitcoin, because it can't and neither can anyone else. That's what makes Bitcoin special."
8617,2017-12-11 13:00,"I think that's a great point. And in Bitcoin there is, by design, no authoritative source of information or anything else. So it's more difficult to have good communication and transparency."
8618,2017-12-11 08:00,Bitcoin Core is a software project. It shouldn't be publishing much more than release announcements. But definitely open to suggestions for how to collaborate better with other members of the ecosystem.
8619,2017-12-11 06:00,People should at least get to decide with unbiased information. Not under the false pretenses of following “Satoshi”.
8620,2017-11-29 18:00,"It's a bit of a crazy hypothetical, but.. there are other centralizing effects of bigger blocks such as longer block propagation times causing a higher orphan rate for smaller miners so incentivizing big miners. But it would help for sure.."
8621,2017-11-29 13:00,"It's too annoying for me to keep loading these up incognito to rebut his arguments. Sorry. But no, I do not agree with that. Or I do think that there are security/sovereignty benefits that come from running your own node."
8622,2017-11-29 09:00,"If a sufficient number of users no longer assign value to the money if it is attacked, then the economic incentives for the attack go away (why print more worthless money?). Providing right incentives for miners is critical security property."
8623,2017-11-29 09:00,The other issue was how much hostility we got for this questioning. Accused of attacking them. We have obligation to hold everyone to high standards.
8624,2017-11-29 09:00,"I did as well, but I only even wrote it because Twitter auto-completed #NotBCash when I was trying to write #No2X . I figured Twitter knows best. :)"
8625,2017-11-28 21:00,"SPV security is a bit nuanced, but putting aside security of a particular transaction. What about the security of the money itself? SPV can't tell you whether it's being inflated. If you want to protect against that you either need to run a full node or depend on others."
8626,2017-11-28 17:00,"Depends on what you think BTC is. If you want to verify certain rules haven’t changed, how else could you know?"
8627,2017-11-28 16:00,"No. Holding, using, buying, valuing BTC has an effect. All the effect in aggregate."
8628,2017-11-28 16:00,To A? I don’t know. Depends on the share of economic activity and the threat model. I’d say we’ve slid too far into let’s just trust Coinbase/bc.i land if you ask me.
8629,2017-11-28 16:00,But your own node is an economic node of you base your own decisions on it. So is everyone else’s. You believing in your own particular vision of BTC is what helps give that vision value.
8630,2017-11-28 16:00,What matters is A) enough do that there are too many people to coerce into changing rules (2X would have succeeded if their were no full nodes) B) you can run your own if you want to. Then all that matters to you is your 1 node.
8631,2017-11-28 16:00,"Ah. Just saw his explanation (I’m blocked). He is operating under the assumption that it is the miners that determine the rules of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is what you want it to be. If you want to follow whatever rules the miners come up with, he’s right"
8632,2017-11-28 16:00,Unique security provided by miners is ordering of transactions.
8633,2017-11-28 16:00,Security comes from verifying for yourself so primary security is running own node. Also get herd security by having many indep ppl verifying who would raise hell if inflation or censorship e.g. Govt or central power can’t coerce all node operators like they could a few miners
8634,2017-11-28 11:00,I think CSW must be an undercover agent for #NotBCash . He discredits himself and BCH more than anyone else. “More non mining nodes makes the system LESS secure.” - CSW
8635,2017-11-25 16:00,This is great! Good for everyone. Thanks Brian and Coinbase! https:// twitter.com/brian_armstron g/status/934563254101164033 …
8636,2017-11-25 10:00,"Of course it is not binary. The argument Adam is making is that too many people don't sufficiently value the effort and emphasis on security. But if he is claiming Core is safe and others aren't, then I agree, that's BS."
8637,2017-11-25 07:00,Is your argument that we should emulate that fatal airplane crash?
8638,2017-11-23 11:00,Implication here was Metronome now has a token lockup. Not true. 5% still goes to Bloq with no lockup. https:// twitter.com/jgarzik/status /932308107962736640 …
8639,2017-11-20 16:00,"He shouldn’t have let the implication that Core was involved slide but at the end of the day, Jeff is also a victim of these attacks. That’s unacceptable that he feels in fear."
8640,2017-11-20 15:00,I agree there is some value. But the balance is all wrong. Have you seen @joi 's keynote from @ScalingBitcoin . First speaker here: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=3pd6xH jLbhs …
8641,2017-11-19 18:00,"Vitalik, let me shorten that for you: Basic tip: If it’s an ICO, skip them. https:// twitter.com/vitalikbuterin /status/932404221260918785 …"
8642,2017-11-19 10:00,From your own FAQ: “Will there be a lock-up in tokens retained by Bloq?— Bloq and other Metronome authors will receive 2 million MTN .... Bloq can buy and sell MTN at its discretion. ...”
8643,2017-11-18 09:00,But he tried to pass it off as not a mistake. That’s what rubbed me the wrong way.
8644,2017-11-17 18:00,It's closer to being handed a Somalian passport in case your EU passport doesn't work out. Maybe that's just not worth it to you?
8645,2017-11-17 08:00,The reason I tweeted is I saw him defending 494784 by saying it was the first block after the fork block. That height is meaningless. There is no defense. I’ve made major mistakes myself. But you have to admit them.
8646,2017-11-17 08:00,"For 2X, there were two heights of interest: 494,782 - the last common block and 494,783 - the first forked block. The only height that was advertised, 494,784, is just completely wrong. This was a huge mistake, no way around that."
8647,2017-11-15 18:00,Well that’s the question. I think sacrificing the decentralized uncontrollable nature eliminates those other value propositions. But I have no problem with other people trying it out. Bitcoin will probably fail too.
8648,2017-11-15 18:00,"But you’re pre assuming it’s a money. If it’s just a good payment tech, there is no reason it also needs to be money."
8649,2017-11-15 17:00,"If coin’s value proposition is payments then ppl can move in/out for payments & total mkt cap need be no more than float of payments in transit at any 1 time. So it’s not what economic majority wants, it’s that only uncontrollable store of value has potential for real coin value"
8650,2017-11-14 10:00,"I’m pretty sure he was tweeting the same way before he worked for Blockstream. But he doesn’t need me to defend him, I don’t think anyone likes appealing to CEO’s and investors to get someone fired."
8651,2017-11-14 10:00,Vinny that’s exactly the kind of humorous yet derogatory yet meaningful tweet @Excellion would make!
8652,2017-11-11 08:00,Who gets to decide who is malicious?
8653,2017-11-11 03:00,Discuss all u want. I was answering direct question about whether any of ur peers disagree. I’m not wasting my time on this.
8654,2017-11-11 03:00,I think miner centralization is one of many challenges BTC faces. A PoW change HF is the nuclear option and there is far less consensus for that than 2X.
8655,2017-11-11 03:00,Uhh. I hope you realize it’s not that simple. Disposing of BTC certainly is taxable. It’s treated like any other asset. Check w/ tax attorney.
8656,2017-11-11 03:00,"I haven’t read this whole thread but my opinion is this discussion of changing PoW is ridiculous, unnecessary and unhelpful."
8657,2017-11-10 11:00,you sure do tweet about it a lot for someone who doesn't care
8658,2017-11-10 11:00,"It's not clear what the ideal PoW would be, and SHA256 might be good. Something easy to ASIC that will become more and more commoditized. I don't think current mining paradigm has proven itself broken though there are areas of concern."
8659,2017-11-10 07:00,"Did you miss the part about within the consensus rules""? Think of Core as an implementation of a defined protocol and think of the process of deciding changes to the protocol rules as taking place outside the context of Core, in the wider community. It'll help you understand."""
8660,2017-11-10 06:00,I disagree. When @wehrtyou built a company using FreeBSD we contributed to its development. And that’s 2 steps removed compared to BTC cos.
8661,2017-11-10 06:00,I’d love to work on meeting the needs of businesses. Within the consensus rules.
8662,2017-11-10 05:00,Is this the new normal? Constantly sniping? Let’s move forward. Find something you love and work on it and don’t disparage others.
8663,2017-11-10 05:00,Maybe now is not the right time to have this discussion. Let’s revisit in a month. I hope you’ll reconsider. I certainly feel it’s valuable use of my time and I have no company depending on it.
8664,2017-11-10 05:00,99% of Core Dev work has nothing to do with consensus changes. It’s valuable work that needs to be done. Reducing protocol development to a block size constant is naive.
8665,2017-11-10 04:00,How is it not worth one developer to work on the underlying protocol your business is built on?
8666,2017-11-09 20:00,"I’m not trying to force anyone to do anything. But Bitcoin isn’t magic. We can’t be upset when it doesn’t do everything we want it to do with no work put in. We all want same thing, but community rejected easy looking “solutions” that were anything but."
8667,2017-11-09 19:00,"You question didn’t say they don’t want to. Can they build other layer 2 solutions? This is what BItcoin is. We can try to make it better, move to something else, or complain."
8668,2017-11-09 19:00,"Vinny, we can’t rehash the same battle over and over. Please move on to being constructive instead."
8669,2017-11-09 12:00,"Thanks for the shout out, but I actually haven't been working on that or much of anything last couple months. Mostly @pwuille . But back to work now!"
8670,2017-11-09 08:00,Patience Erik. We're ALL trying to build something great here. But what looks like the easy solution is often no solution at all. No one wants to price ppl out of using BTC.
8671,2017-11-09 08:00,"I don't even know what that means wrt Core dev. Either all have it or none, depending on your definition. If anything, there is far less central power under @orionwl than under @gavinandresen . Does anyone disagree with that?"
8672,2017-11-09 07:00,"Needless to say I don't approve of that tweet. It was in reply to an also unnecessary snarky comment, but that doesn't excuse it. But Eric != core devs"" by any stretch of the imagination."""
8673,2017-11-09 05:00,Why are you calling it a core dev victory taunt? I haven’t seen any core contributors say anything like that.
8674,2017-11-09 05:00,The Core dev part of this tweet is just blatantly false. There are more active and involved Core developers now than ever before.
8675,2017-11-08 18:00,I _mostly_ agree. But I certainly expended a lot of personal effort and time while also trying to say I wouldn't support the fork. I think others did too.
8676,2017-11-08 13:00,This momentous day is the perfect time to finally post @Excellion 's hat at the summit of Mt. Everest courtesy of @patrickmauroii !! Make Bitcoin Great Again! #NO2X pic.twitter.com/52ocSFBHBC
8677,2017-11-08 12:00,"Or perhaps those are the people we should thank for acting responsibly. It's hard to admit you were wrong and reverse course, and it should be applauded."
8678,2017-11-08 11:00,I agree with the first part.
8679,2017-11-08 11:00,I disagree. I will write more later but I have had a lot of faith restored that people were able to respond to the community.
8680,2017-11-08 09:00,But in reality what disappoints me about every single exchange is they haven't spoken out more forcefully about lack of replay protection!
8681,2017-11-08 09:00,"I'm disappointed in Gemini's stance, but they have taken what could be called the neutral"" stance. No one has taken the stance that 2X will be called BTC initially, and many have that 1X will."""
8682,2017-11-08 09:00,What I meant is that if we didn't all think it was False we would be much more up-in-arms. Most exchanges have said they'll at least start calling 1X BTC.
8683,2017-11-08 03:00,"Yes of course it’s False. Here’s how you know, the low level background noise you hear against 2X isn’t full revolt"
8684,2017-11-07 14:00,Not close. Just zero. If it happens your RNG is broken.
8685,2017-11-07 08:00,How do you know? How are these things decided?
8686,2017-11-07 06:00,But now precedent has been set. There will be no argument. It’s why setting precedents is important.
8687,2017-11-07 06:00,You’re not accepting your part in causing chaos with 2X. Everyone says it’s not their fault but they don’t stand up and do the right thing
8688,2017-11-07 05:00,Thanks but I think I’ve said my piece. 2X is already over. What’s disappointing is how little we’ve learned.
8689,2017-11-07 03:00,2X is meant to meet mandate set by agreement of a few cos. If those cos asked for RP they should reject 2X until it has it. But they didn’t.
8690,2017-11-07 03:00,"Many of us, myself included, made constructive comments on RP including asking for optional"
8691,2017-11-07 03:00,Thats nonsense. P2SH RP was an idiotic design but infinitely better than nothing. Removing it was definition of perfect being enemy of good
8692,2017-11-06 20:00,Core has never made any agreement
8693,2017-11-06 18:00,There will be no reason to change PoW. That is an extreme measure that we are nowhere near needing.
8694,2017-11-06 18:00,Hard to tweet. Mkt can demonstrate what users decided in aggregate. But every indiv user picks for themselves & may not follow mkt. See BCH
8695,2017-11-06 15:00,"The whole point of the article is that is not an issue with optional RP, in fact there are no downsides."
8696,2017-11-06 15:00,"1 half is HF so has to be done on side already HFing. The SF half requires much longer deployment for big installed base. Also, precedent"
8697,2017-11-06 15:00,"Yes, markets will show what users have decided in aggregate. But many indiv users especially on NO2X side will make same choice regardless"
8698,2017-11-06 15:00,That’s their excuse for mandatory (strong) RP. There is no excuse for optional replay protection.
8699,2017-11-06 15:00,That doesn’t make sense. Every company that signed NYA is busy writing support for both forks. How would it be worse to have RP in protocol?
8700,2017-11-06 14:00,I'm in charge on the weekends. 7 days a week was too much for Greg.
8701,2017-11-06 14:00,And very likely that there will be mistakes that cause user loss. Also undue burden on smaller companies who have to do all the same work.
8702,2017-11-06 14:00,I most definitely did RSVP with a Will Not Be Attending.
8703,2017-11-06 13:00,I just published “No2x: No Replay Protection” https:// medium.com/p/no2x-no-repl ay-protection-4535ddd89017 …
8704,2017-11-06 12:00,"The market shows how ppl have decided and may influence some ppls decision. But look at BCH believers, they decided on Cash, not the market."
8705,2017-11-06 12:00,"We the users. It's the whole point of BTC. You choose your own money. You might consider what the market does, but it doesn't decide for you"
8706,2017-11-06 12:00,"Everyone and anyone. That's the whole point, u get to choose ur own Bitcoin. Certain characteristics u might not care about and others u do."
8707,2017-11-06 11:00,"I have just one question for you Jeff. Who do you think we"" is in the context of that quote?"""
8708,2017-11-06 10:00,But I hope not. I hope we join sides before next level comes otherwise we won’t be ready.
8709,2017-11-06 10:00,Exactly right. I thought that NYA was final boss on this level but now I think these guys may have one more go at it.
8710,2017-11-06 08:00,"I watched, and I'm saying the same thing now. We shouldnt be fooled into the excitement of free money from air drop fork. There is real cost"
8711,2017-11-06 08:00,I dont understand that argument. There is literally no downside to at least offering optional RP in new fork. Of course they should do it.
8712,2017-11-06 08:00,I don't understand why you don't consider RP a good process. Just the existence of good processes doesn't mean people won't pick bad ones.
8713,2017-11-06 08:00,"So by us valuing 2X at 15%, we're implicitly saying we don't mind things being done this way. Market should value responsible choices. 4/4"
8714,2017-11-06 08:00,"If 2X was worth 1% instead of 15%, then no exchanges services would be halting b/c of lack of RP. They'd just cary on to support BTC. 3/"
8715,2017-11-06 08:00,It's about building a culture where we don't assign value to things that are done in a destructive and unethical manner. 2/
8716,2017-11-06 08:00,Bitcoin is a social construct as well as technical. My argument is this is a social problem. It's not about telling them what to do. 1/
8717,2017-11-06 08:00,Which we have.
8718,2017-11-06 08:00,"Sure they should be free to go their own way. But without destroying everyone else in the process. New network magic, address format, RP etc"
8719,2017-11-06 07:00,Are we talking about the same medium post? He’s just trying to have a plan for all possible outcomes.
8720,2017-11-06 05:00,"Stop FUD. He’s discussing a hypothetical black swan event. His point is valid: We decide what BTC is, not the market. Market just shows u"
8721,2017-11-06 05:00,2X has been reduced to arguing there was one poll that showed 40% support. 40% might as well be 0 you need overwhelming consent. #NO2X https:// twitter.com/btc_de_blog/st atus/926405499561697282 …
8722,2017-11-05 20:00,I think by that logic they are saying you can't ever have a soft fork again? Maybe I don't understand it.
8723,2017-11-05 19:00,That was the argument against mandatory RP. There is no argument against optional RP b/c there is no downside. None. What would it even be?
8724,2017-11-05 19:00,A better question is did you ask @jgarzik to add replay protection? NYA signers need to go on the record with their position on RP.
8725,2017-11-05 15:00,"For the record, I argued strongly against anyone from Core going to HK exactly because people like you would misinterpret it like this."
8726,2017-11-05 14:00,"If you're concerned about it, I suggest you raise it with @coincenter . Their whole purpose is to help protect freedom of things like this."
8727,2017-11-05 08:00,Convenient how you put two things in there so we can all decide which one is certain.
8728,2017-11-05 08:00,Big difference btwn having no opinion on the technical change (or even wanting it) and failing to make a stand against the process precedent
8729,2017-11-04 16:00,But even that doesn’t make sense. The market will still decide. It’s just whether it happens cleanly or in a giant dangerous mess.
8730,2017-11-04 16:00,Some were misled. Many didn’t really care to find out.
8731,2017-11-04 15:00,Right. Asking for RP 100s of times on GitHub & ML was wrong approach. Allowed @jgarzik & @mikebelshe to make terrible decisions for all NYA
8732,2017-11-04 15:00,This is very low bar for decent behavior. Optional replay protection has absolutely no downside for new fork & immense benefits for everyone
8733,2017-11-04 15:00,It boggles the mind that anyone would support a HF without at least optional replay protection. We have to be outraged
8734,2017-11-04 15:00,If ecosystem companies all refused to provide support for reckless HF’s like this they would never have any value and there’d be no risk.
8735,2017-11-04 15:00,It sets a terrible precedent that anyone can bring the entire network to a halt just by building some minimal support for a fork coin w/o RP
8736,2017-11-04 15:00,If I ran a Bitcoin company I wouldn’t shutdown operations for days because some irresponsible ppl were launching a HF w/o replay protection.
8737,2017-11-04 14:00,I wish it were true. But they will twist the history and try again. Could have said same about XT letter and yet here we are.
8738,2017-11-04 14:00,The behavior of every CEO who signed NYA is far stranger. Careless disregard for stability and desired incorruptibility of Bitcoin.
8739,2017-11-04 14:00,Enough. Core devs did not ever promise anything. And if anyone claims they are promising something you shouldn’t believe them. They can’t.
8740,2017-11-04 12:00,"In the event 2X doesn't win, it'll be hard to prove"" it would have been bad if it had. But IMO will be very positive that BTC resisted"""
8741,2017-11-04 12:00,"In 10 or 20 years, if BTC has failed b/c it came under control of govts/businesses, we might be able to point back to this as the start."
8742,2017-11-04 10:00,Certainly a factor. But before BIP91 unsafe to support. IMO biggest reason segwit activated was fees increasing and segwit was already there
8743,2017-11-04 10:00,"My memory was NYA decided to do compatible BIP 91 earlier which would bring all Core nodes along, but perhaps I'm remembering incorrectly?"
8744,2017-11-04 10:00,"For clarity. I think 2X very unlikely to succeed. If it does, its damaging to Bitcoins core value. Maybe but not definitely irrecoverably so"
8745,2017-11-04 09:00,Yes you have been supportive of segwit. Please roll out soon. But I'm in no position to criticize others as Core is still doing it too.
8746,2017-11-04 09:00,Well lets hope all of us can learn from past experience whether the actions we've taken have helped or hurt.
8747,2017-11-04 08:00,"Also, I've said before, a lot of credit goes to BTC1 team for not even risking disruption of BIP148 and activating segwit compatibly. Thanks"
8748,2017-11-04 08:00,That said. If we'd gotten closer to BIP 148 happening without support. I would have continued to speak out against it louder.
8749,2017-11-04 08:00,True. But individual users changing their own rules effectively hurt only themselves. Major ecosystem companies affect everyone.
8750,2017-11-04 08:00,"As a serious question, so you think its ok for hard forks to happen that are obviously contentious? This is the part I don't understand."
8751,2017-11-04 08:00,I did. Repeatedly. For example here and here: https:// github.com/bitcoin/bitcoi n/pull/10417#issuecomment-302197833 … https:// twitter.com/morcosa/status /869322267100160001 …
8752,2017-11-04 08:00,"It's a very small group. I've been repeatedly asked that if I could get Core to agree, they'd happily delay. Core doesn't decide for users."
8753,2017-11-04 08:00,That seems a bit too much of a conspiracy theory. But certainly negligence with protecting customers funds.
8754,2017-11-04 08:00,"When it causes problems, you have no excuses. If your name is on that agreement still, you are responsible for no replay protection."
8755,2017-11-04 08:00,You designed the changes in a small group. Could have insisted then and more importantly refused to adopt it after without replay protection
8756,2017-11-04 08:00,Let's set the record straight. Who from NYA is responsible for no replay protection? You cant all act helpless and say its out of ur hands
8757,2017-11-04 08:00,That makes no sense. Core is an existing installed base with no planned changes. You were part of the small group that planned BTC1 changes
8758,2017-11-04 07:00,I suspect Cash's new DAA will improve current situation for both coins. Just in time for 2X to mess it up again. Hope that's short lived
8759,2017-11-04 07:00,"Long term it won't matter, b/c if BTC succeeds it'll dominate alt chains and won't worry about competing for hash. For now, alt bubble hurts"
8760,2017-11-04 07:00,Bitcoin wasn't designed for sharing SHA256 capacity with other chains. Block time volatility much higher due to losing hash to Bitcoin Cash https:// twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/s tatus/926791347016646658 …
8761,2017-11-03 08:00,This is an excellent thread that matches my view! https:// twitter.com/rjenkins_atl/s tatus/926447330542477312 …
8762,2017-11-03 07:00,Have to recognize that we’ll always argue about consensus. Need to learn lessons for what the right way to fork is if you are determined to
8763,2017-11-03 07:00,If there was adequate replay protection and time for all services to implement Day 1 support for both chains. It really wouldn’t matter.
8764,2017-11-03 07:00,The thing that makes me angry is the lack of ability to adapt to the clear evidence that support is lacking. I dont know way to improve that
8765,2017-11-03 07:00,https:// twitter.com/morcosa/status /926439255781625857 …
8766,2017-11-03 07:00,Agreed. But upon reflection I think it’s better to read charitably. Email sounded bad but 2X supporters encouraging each other should be ok
8767,2017-11-03 07:00,Don’t sell all your BTC or B2X unless your’re ok with the risk that you made wrong choice.
8768,2017-11-03 07:00,It’s perfectly reasonable to suggest ppl make their preferences known in the market but needs to come with warning about risks of unknown.
8769,2017-11-03 06:00,Never mind. Missed that is was a trick question about miners deciding
8770,2017-11-03 06:00,I don’t even see an option to continue the status quo which is by far most likely outcome.
8771,2017-11-03 06:00,This whole topic is very disturbing. Coordinated action in the market designed to move the price?
8772,2017-11-02 17:00,So by your own admission you are using 2X to make Bitcoin unusable for days after nearly 0 downtime in 9 yrs. Thanks https:// blog.bitgo.com/bitgos-segwit2 x-plan-bb8f17e972d3?source=twitterShare-6265bfec3c93-1509664245 …
8773,2017-11-02 15:00,He left out the scenario that he’d think most likely: miners start new worthless fork and pump that to infinity. Moar money!

8775,2017-11-02 06:00,Btw. I’m only discussing hypothetical if we take Bobby at his word and they don’t switch to higher priced chain quickly. Seems very unlikely
8776,2017-11-02 06:00,Mostly agree. But might be a painful bump in the road.
8777,2017-11-02 06:00,Probably won’t kill Bitcoin and next time they will know they shouldn’t use their hash power to make political points
8778,2017-11-02 06:00,"I suspect they’re economically rational, even BTCC, but may need lesson. Mkt px of both coins will crash if hashing sticks to 2X despite px"
8779,2017-11-02 06:00,Sure. But current price of BTC should reflect its long term value so if they act in way to impair that should quickly affect current price
8780,2017-11-02 06:00,If miners aren’t long term economically rational then Bitcoin is broken. Will be put to the test in 2 weeks. @YourBTCC raising doubts.
8781,2017-11-02 02:00,"Bobby Lee, @YourBTCC , first to say he’s leaving Bitcoin for 2X regardless of market’s acceptance. Just a proposal huh @mikebelshe ? Bye Bobby"
8782,2017-11-01 07:00,Shouldn't you provide a photo of you dressed up as someone else?
8783,2017-11-01 07:00,More valuable is insufficient for me to support it. Has to be about survival of Bitcoin.
8784,2017-11-01 07:00,"Probably doable in dire circumstances. Don't know how easy would be to get consensus. It's theoretically an option, but can't just"" do it."""
8785,2017-11-01 06:00,He claimed it’s just a proposal while previously claiming miners would all support it and old chain would be unusable. Where is the choice?
8786,2017-10-31 12:00,They don't have to represent everyone. But a significant enough number wanted to express opposition to show there isn't consensus for 2X.

8829,2017-10-25 15:00,Brian that seems reasonable. But burden of proof must be on new rules. Not a fixed metric where a temporarily more work chain can change BTC

8862,2017-10-20 14:00,Core isn’t and shouldn’t be responsible for the actions of or the representative of the interests of the user community.
8863,2017-10-20 14:00,Core definitely takes flak for anyone that disagrees with e.g. big blockers. But that problem is worse if more ppl defer to Core.

8865,2017-10-20 14:00,I disagree. Bitcoin is made stronger by everyone having their own opinion.

8869,2017-10-19 18:00,I don’t want the change in part because of how many others don’t. We’ll just have to agree to disagree on whether that’s logical.
8870,2017-10-19 08:00,It had much broader consent than 2X. But also it wasn’t rammed through. It sat there waiting to build support. Until these same ppl pushed

8886,2017-10-14 17:00,I don’t want apologies. I just want people to learn how Bitcoin governance works (or really how it doesn’t work) so we can get back to work.
8887,2017-10-14 16:00,I hope we can be friends at the conclusion too. My only ask is whichever of us was wrong about outcome learns something from this experience
8888,2017-10-14 16:00,If you dont ask. If you dont try for consent. If you just declare it. The answer is no and ur change will fail. Doesnt matter what it is.
8889,2017-10-14 16:00,There are many thousands of people who would trade every one of their BTC to keep its incorruptible properties. Those ppl give BTC its value
8890,2017-10-14 16:00,What are u talking about? Of course there is. How have u not been hearing us all these years.? We’ll never accept a forced consensus change!
8891,2017-10-14 16:00,And what does that say about your proposed change if you believe one of largest exchanges won’t even recognize it?
8892,2017-10-14 16:00,Consensus among miners is great. But it’s only one part of the community. Need consensus from everyone else too.
8893,2017-10-14 16:00,I don’t think you understand risk then.
8894,2017-10-14 15:00,But _no_ twitter polls favor 2X. Not 1. Futures “manipulation” only in 1 direction? And at 0.13 you would think someone would buy 2X future.
8895,2017-10-14 15:00,Oops. Premature send. ..and look at it with fresh eyes. No one should feel obligated to change their money
8896,2017-10-14 15:00,"Mike. Come on. If not everyone wants to follow your changes, you can’t say they are the ones advocating for a split. Take a step back"
8897,2017-10-14 12:00,I guess we’ll never know. Should have been open meeting. You could have published minutes after the fact at least. Even Fed does that.
8898,2017-10-14 12:00,But we won’t even get to that point. Market is speaking more and more clearly every day.
8899,2017-10-14 12:00,This ideologically driven purpose makes BTC a stable equilibrium and 2X unstable. Any hashing majority for 2X will be temporary at best.
8900,2017-10-14 12:00,Key difference btwn BTC and 2X: 2X proponents will abandon ship if they arent majority. BTCers would happily continue with smaller community
8901,2017-10-14 12:00,I prefer to see it as invitation to not be bothered with BizCoin. I’ll work on BTC where changes are only proposals unless/until consensus
8902,2017-10-14 11:00,2X now then “dozens to hundreds of additional capacity increases going forward”. Will you get a say in those? #No2X https:// medium.com/@mikebelshe/ca rpe-diem-for-bitcoin-9f02e8263126?source=twitterShare-6265bfec3c93-1508001625 …
8903,2017-10-13 11:00,But that’s where they should be. For most ICO’s: funds raised go into pockets of founders and token goes to zero. No relation btwn two.
8904,2017-10-12 07:00,"Bigger concern, we repeat this all again because: Core, censorship, FUD, “culture of reprisals”, etc are to blame, not community rejection."
8905,2017-10-12 07:00,That has virtually no chance of happening. Even ViaBTC letting hashers choose. Vast majority will follow economic incentives.
8906,2017-10-11 07:00,Well I certainly agree with the fact that their github is unreadable.
8907,2017-10-11 04:00,I side with @jgarzik on this one. Its annoying how often people do this with Core. Could have asked question differently not on tech channel
8908,2017-10-10 10:00,I’m curious if that’s from your own reading of the T&C or based on what others have said.
8909,2017-10-09 14:00,"Trying to give benefit of doubt, but the devel process and project governance appears to be a disgrace. Ironic considering criticism of Core"
8910,2017-10-09 14:00,"Just joined the slack. Saw it mentioned, but where and how was this decision for further consensus change made? Can you point me to that?"
8911,2017-10-09 12:00,Not if it's a PROPOSED change. That's the whole point of having the spec ahead of time.
8912,2017-10-09 12:00,"Well he and Belshe certainly triggered me. I'm tired of this. Offer 2X, let people choose it if they want. But stop trying to trick people!"
8913,2017-10-09 12:00,"Someone making a compatible implementation would want to look at both, but probably better to start with spec to avoid copying any mistakes."
8914,2017-10-09 12:00,I'm not trying to argue the BIP controls. I'm trying to say we should specify what the code is trying to accomplish and do our best.
8915,2017-10-09 11:00,@tdryja did and found that specs were initially lacking. But at least they tried to specify! I hope his feedback resulted in clearer specs.
8916,2017-10-09 11:00,"Correct. It doesn't meet my standards. It also doesn't meet the definition of specification: describing or identifying something precisely"""""
8917,2017-10-09 11:00,BIP141 and BIP143 are examples. Specific enough you can create compatible implementation. With actual code it's 2 ways of saying same thing.
8918,2017-10-09 11:00,Both are just Sergio's BIP no? Did you read the BIP? Would you like to call that a specification? Because I do not.
8919,2017-10-09 11:00,But you should at least try to independently describe the changes so people can at least no one changes are intentional!
8920,2017-10-09 11:00,Their BIP does neither! Too hard to watch an active code base for changes. Yes unintentional differences might make codebase definitive.
8921,2017-10-09 11:00,All consensus changes are spelled out in English in BIP's and in code snippets incorporated into the BIP. Helps cross check implementation.
8922,2017-10-09 11:00,excuse me... even they think it won't be more than 100%. only 99.94% of nodes/spv clients will follow longest chain according to them.
8923,2017-10-09 11:00,"If they would fairly present the choice they want to offer, the rest of us could get back to work instead of constantly having to debunk."
8924,2017-10-09 11:00,Because there are many people who listen to @jgarzik @mikebelshe when they say detractors are organized campaign and 909.94% will follow.
8925,2017-10-09 11:00,You can't just link to the active codebase which is changing without notice unless you're following Slack and consider that a spec.

8933,2017-10-05 15:00,"Even if it’s not an attack, why not make it better? Craziness of merging consensus changes in under 6 weeks aside."
8934,2017-10-05 14:00,Hey great!! Congrats!
8935,2017-10-05 14:00,My point was developing segwit was a lot of forward progress unless your goal is the narrow focus of immediate capacity increase.
8936,2017-10-05 14:00,How do you guarantee an answer?
8937,2017-10-05 14:00,2+ years? Segwit had only been out for 6 mos at time of NYA. I object to characterization that nothing was happening to get to that point
8938,2017-10-04 18:00,"Only point of that story is it’s going to be no surprise that everyone has a different version of what happened now, 2 years later."
8939,2017-10-04 18:00,"But when I got back and tried to understand what the common understanding was, it was abundantly clear there wasn’t one. Just 10 mins later."
8940,2017-10-04 18:00,The moment they all stopped discussing and had a “plan” was the moment I had lost a coin flip and was out of room moderating round table.
8941,2017-10-04 18:00,"If bc.i wants to support both chains, they should be welcome to. But it would be a shame if they stopped supporting users on original rules"
8942,2017-10-04 18:00,Does this mean you intend to move forward with 2X? Will you give your customers a way to access to their original Bitcoins as well?
8943,2017-10-04 14:00,"Jeff, I think many of the attacks are unwarranted and unacceptable. But I dont see any evidence of an organized campaign. Organized by who?"
8944,2017-10-04 14:00,Please stop painting Core with actions of a few ppl. Most outrageous comments aren't from contributors. That is you stooping to their level.
8945,2017-10-04 14:00,I don’t know if I would use the word “attack” but I agree with the sentiment. There is at the very least an abdication of the duty of care.
8946,2017-10-04 13:00,I argued against that as well.

8953,2017-10-04 05:00,That’s a very confused move. Having network partition happen all of a sudden when fork occurs is much worse for them with minority clients.
8954,2017-10-02 20:00,Satoshi authored it? Why didn’t you tell me?! Count me in then! #Yes2X It’s late. I’m going to bed.

8960,2017-10-02 17:00,Great. So ignore them. They aren’t Core. In fact only Greg is even part of it. And same Core developers still wouldn’t agree to 2X w/o them.
8961,2017-10-02 17:00,Maybe because they don’t want to be attacked the way you are attacking Todd/Maxwell or the way Chaincode is being attacked on r/Btc now.
8962,2017-10-02 17:00,The point is there are lots of developers who participate. Way more than any other Bitcoin implementation ever. They just don’t speak up
8963,2017-10-02 16:00,I think you are the first person to ever accuse me of being a yes man. That’s quite humorous.
8964,2017-10-02 16:00,Suffice it to say I disagree with your characterization. It’s easy to make them the villains but it is wrong.
8965,2017-10-02 16:00,Why have none of the new venues become the new watering holes after years? People are really that sticky?
8966,2017-10-02 16:00,Do you know how absurd that sounds? Do you think Theymos controls the internet? What about http:// Bitcoin.com ? r/BTC? Twitter? Medium?
8967,2017-10-02 16:00,Always? Are you referring to us? None of our employees have been working for us for more than 9 months.
8968,2017-10-02 16:00,Maxwell doesn’t decide Bitcoin. Core doesn’t decide Bitcoin. The community does. And whoever wants to change the rules needs to convince it
8969,2017-10-02 16:00,All the people that don’t believe in 2X
8970,2017-10-02 16:00,But it is beyond clear you don’t have the overwhelming majority you wanted. NYA signers have to accept that. We arent going along. #NO2X
8971,2017-10-02 16:00,The problem is not lack of venue. The problem is that without a market it’s hard to measure support.
8972,2017-10-02 16:00,Jeff. You were a mailing list moderator. Why is it right out? And the entire Reddit platform is out? The world has no place to discuss?
8973,2017-10-02 06:00,Those for whom theres only 1 choice wil form critical mass. BTC is uncontrollable uncensorable money believed in by cypherpunks/libertarians
8974,2017-10-02 06:00,BTC is money and money is about network. Everyone wants to be where everyone else is. Including miners. So ideologues will determine outcome
8975,2017-10-02 06:00,I think what he means is he’s going to follow majority of community which is entirely reasonable. Fallacy is initial hash pwr predicts this.
8976,2017-10-01 19:00,"The point of the timing is that the more we settle this ahead of time. The less chaos for everyone. Even if 2X wins, better to know now"
8977,2017-10-01 19:00,I’m not sure what point you are making. Trading an asset you don’t value for one you do is perfectly normal. Only unusual thing is timing
8978,2017-10-01 19:00,Why would I risk anything like that? I’m not willing to make that big a sacrifice for any vision of Bitcoin and I’d never bet that.
8979,2017-10-01 19:00,Making a trade is a way to demonstrate that your signal is not just posture. A significant size makes it clear it’s not just throwing money
8980,2017-10-01 19:00,Me either. It’s why I’m making it clear that I don’t value 2X at all. What happens next is a matter of shared belief. Important to signal.
8981,2017-10-01 19:00,It’s not being clever. It’s the point. I’ll give you 10 2X coins in exchange for 1 BTC if you’d like.
8982,2017-10-01 19:00,I think you misunderstood. I only offered 250 2X coins. They are worth nothing. I am spending no bitcoins.
8983,2017-09-30 16:00,I think they’re on to something then

8991,2017-09-29 11:00,It was 16% for and 17% against. You were claiming polls that showed 2X support. We're at 2. Mining pools and bitcoinocracy (2 addresses)
8992,2017-09-29 11:00,"Does http:// Coin.dance have a poll showing support for 2X? I saw 16%. Yes mining pools support 2X, but what about users?"
8993,2017-09-29 11:00,Huh? I have photos of me in a UASF hat and I was vehemently opposed to BIP148. But the idea of UASF in general I do support!
8994,2017-09-29 10:00,"Have you looked at the amounts on those polls? Two large addresses of 45K and 10K make up the majority of the vote. But ok, that's 1 poll."
8995,2017-09-29 09:00,So are there any venues in which you have supporters? Are polls possible in those venues? What is the explanation for why none are public?
8996,2017-09-29 09:00,"It is interesting that we don't see ANY polls which point to 2X having even a simple majority, much less overwhelming consensus. https:// twitter.com/DanDarkPill/st atus/913702839226130432 …"
8997,2017-09-29 09:00,NO
8998,2017-09-28 07:00,"Like I said, who knows if that's right model for building a cryptocurrency, but there's a critical mass of Bitcoiners who believe in that."
8999,2017-09-28 07:00,But that's the Bitcoin ethos. You don't tell people what software to run or change the definition of their money without their consent.
9000,2017-09-28 07:00,It's a tradeoff. But being able to run years old software and still agree on the state of the UTXO set is something of significant value.
9001,2017-09-28 07:00,"The vast majority of the crazy is only to achieve the backwards compatibility. If we could do HF's willy nilly, there is tons to clean up."
9002,2017-09-28 07:00,"It's ok if it takes a long time for a change to happen. I don't know the best way to pull the trigger, but we've seen BIP 9 is not ideal."
9003,2017-09-28 07:00,"Among other things we reached out to 50+ companies in the space before releasing code. When miners didn't activate, most took it in stride."
9004,2017-09-28 07:00,And consensus is hard to measure. I'm uneasy with some aspects of how segwit was activated. But I believed it had wide consensus.
9005,2017-09-28 07:00,"Shill or not, I agree that there is a difference between SF and HF. There is a difference between proposing and imposing..."
9006,2017-09-28 07:00,"Not sure I can answer on twitter, but I think like all things it's not black and white."
9007,2017-09-28 07:00,No one knows how space will play out but taking first cryptocurrency and keeping it immutable except by widespread consensus is worthy goal.
9008,2017-09-28 07:00,"It's not a dumb war. Not every cryptocurrency has to share this philosophy, but lack of organized governance is something I love about BTC."
9009,2017-09-28 04:00,But even for Bitcoin Core project (1 implementation) no one has control over code changes. All contributors influence what is accepted.
9010,2017-09-28 04:00,Biggest problem with that statement is conflating protocol changes with code changes. No one has control over consensus changes to protocol.
9011,2017-09-28 03:00,Referring to @chaincodelabs ? How do we have any control? Please look at our commits/reviews and decide if that's a good description. https:// twitter.com/jgarzik/status /913025251134590976 …

9014,2017-09-27 08:00,Contributors made multiple proposals (BIP103/Spoonnet). Core project hasnt adopted them bc they havent achieved widespread community support
9015,2017-09-27 07:00,Also anyone else can adopt 2X if they want regardless of what Core does. We’ll keep working on existing BTC rules for ppl who want that.
9016,2017-09-21 09:00,Don’t be pro-Core. Be pro-“your vision for Bitcoin”. Too many people think users blindly follow Core and would follow 2X if Core led.
9017,2017-09-20 19:00,People leaving BTC for ETH is a good thing for both BTC and ETH. Why does everyone always say it like it’s a bad sign? Work on your passion
9018,2017-09-19 14:00,Where do you draw the line for proposed fork that gets to say they don't need to legitimize the existing rules? Surely new fork has burden?
9019,2017-09-19 11:00,It's absurd to say segwit does no harm to those who choose not to use it. At the very least it increases the block size!
9020,2017-09-19 11:00,"Sorry to make light of situation, but he's masterfully ignoring you. Should be meme when ppl won't answer a ?: Why'd you remove FuckNazis?"""""

9023,2017-09-19 10:00,It's all part of our master plan. We'll donate our time and money to Bitcoin and somehow profit from it at the expense of everyone else.

9029,2017-09-19 10:00,"Ah that I agree with! It was in the spirit, just way too rushed and not enough support. There was and is no hurry for consensus changes."
9030,2017-09-19 09:00,You don't think it's important to have more widespread agreement before a hard fork? What are your thoughts on replay protection?
9031,2017-09-19 07:00,That's not the right way of looking at it. There is no we to compromise except everyone. And horse-trading is bad for BTC.
9032,2017-09-19 07:00,"This is an important point. I know you all have businesses to run, but there are so many more of you. There are limited devs trying to work."
9033,2017-09-19 07:00,This is really critical. Regardless of whether users or devs or businesses or miners supported BIP 148. They essentially all wanted segwit.
9034,2017-09-19 07:00,"Sure. We agree. It was no-win b/c of user power. For those of us refusing to compromise on 2x, its the opposite, it's no-win to compromise."
9035,2017-09-19 07:00,"Correct. And I'm glad they did. But why did they? I'm not happy with overall way segwit got activated, but there were some positive lessons."
9036,2017-09-19 07:00,At the end of the day the most important thing achieved by BIP 148 is showing that users are in control. That part I agree with.
9037,2017-09-19 07:00,Believing it has insufficient support is the same as no. But at the end of the day the point is it had no chance of being merged into Core.
9038,2017-09-18 18:00,"W3C abandons consensus. No org should ever govern BTC regardless of their rules, self-sovereignty means each of us enforces consensus. #No2x https:// twitter.com/doctorow/statu s/909855799874265088 …"

9040,2017-09-18 08:00,I don't think that's true. The people I know IRL overwhelmingly support #No2x . Maybe we just have different communities.
9041,2017-09-18 07:00,NYA is a means to an end. It makes sense to argue against that end. Step towards mega blocks and validation of bad governance model.

9043,2017-09-18 06:00,"Many of us don't think another doubling is necessary now, but doesn't mean we think it's ridiculous to consider potential future increases."

9045,2017-09-18 06:00,The 2 major causes of debate: 1- block size increase was way too aggressive 2- it has been repeatedly forced by industry instead of proposed
9046,2017-09-18 06:00,I think you are confusing me with someone else
9047,2017-09-18 06:00,Also I discussed with you plenty. I specifically tried to get you to be more conservative such as BIP 103 and you refused to entertain it.
9048,2017-09-18 06:00,"You have no idea what youre talking about, but to be honest I don't even understand the accusation. It is not my place to compromise."
9049,2017-09-18 06:00,"Correct. I felt it was not clear it had enough support. I feel that broadly the commmunity supported segwit, but it's activation was botched"
9050,2017-09-18 06:00,Are you calling me a liar? I'm pretty sure I've done nothing to earn that.

9056,2017-09-16 21:00,What do you feel about @f2pool_wangchun 's statement about not supporting 2X? At what point is it not overwhelming?
9057,2017-09-16 21:00,"Erik, the point is we can't ever know what hashpower/support a HF will end up with. So ALL HF's must include strong 2-way replay protection"

9195,2017-08-17 08:00,Optional means not breaking compatibility. It's a HF in that it allows (not requires) you to create a tx that wouldn't previously be valid.

9199,2017-08-17 06:00,I'm confident orig chain worth much more but just want you to see that even with your assumptions value will be such that hashing adjusts.

9201,2017-08-17 06:00,Not obvious 2x would even start w/ higher value. Very clear orig chain will have value >> 10-20% of 2x. Hashpower won't be 90/10 for long.
9202,2017-08-17 06:00,More likely hashpower evens out much more quickly. Previous forks showed minority chain starts close to 20% of value then declines below 10%
9203,2017-08-17 06:00,Your logic isn't consistent. If 90% of everything goes to ur chain then blocks slow at first but plenty of capacity since only have 1/10 txs
9204,2017-08-17 06:00,No. Holders in no hurry. Block/hour is fine. Below 5% is maybe questionable. But hashrate can adjust quickly in response to market price.
9205,2017-08-17 06:00,"Perfect. So if we agree that there is another camp that will support original chain, then let's add replay protection."

9285,2017-07-23 09:00,Also many others deserve credit of course. Especially #BIP148 . But #segwit2x did right thing by not splitting with #UASF .
9286,2017-07-23 09:00,If they dont split (my prediction) then ask them why was this dog and pony show necessary. Couldnt they just have activated segwit normally?
9287,2017-07-23 09:00,If they split they may not be so happy with the result and may learn a hard lesson about how Bitcoin should (not) be governed.
9288,2017-07-23 09:00,Also the industry self congratulation needs to be evaluated in the context of their November dilemma. Split or not?
9289,2017-07-23 09:00,It's accurate that w/o @barrysilbert #SegWit probably doesn't get activated this year. Whether ends justify the means remains to be seen.
9290,2017-07-22 12:00,Ugh. I can't get past saying increase BY 400% when you mean increase TO 400%. Speak properly!! (Or write as the case may be)
9291,2017-07-21 21:00,"The firing Core plan started before half this work was done, so the implication is it was never wanted in the first place."
9292,2017-07-21 13:00,That's not the question any more. (well signal) The question is what happens to a stray non-signaling block. Disruption still before 8/1.
9293,2017-07-21 13:00,"Agree 100% but to avoid disruption, better to activate BIP 148 at new height"
9294,2017-07-21 13:00,"I think the rest of the community should enforce BIP91. Don't we all want it? Now that miners have agreed as well, we all get on same page"
9295,2017-07-21 13:00,Is BIP 91 the new rules of Bitcoin? I say YES. And I think @bitcoincoreorg should enforce the new rules of Bitcoin ASAP!
9296,2017-07-21 06:00,You act like the status quo isn't already burdensome regulation. ULC is huge improvement! Most in industry very supportive.
9297,2017-07-20 17:00,"Without a doubt. I, like many, underestimated BIP 148."
9298,2017-07-20 17:00,I'm glad we got segwit but would argue against this approach for any consensus change. Luckily it only worked b/c community wanted segwit.
9299,2017-07-20 17:00,"When majority of miners collude to orphan your blocks, u don't have much choice. Meetings at Marriott are bad way to make consensus changes"

9305,2017-07-18 08:00,The whole point of Bitcoin is there is no one who governs it. It evolves by the elusive process of shared belief and consensus.

9311,2017-07-16 10:00,Bitcoin Core is nothing. No obligation to do anything. It's only what the community wants that matters. And they have not agreed on anything
9312,2017-07-16 09:00,But I admit we run the risk they'll cause major damage to Bitcoin learning that.
9313,2017-07-16 09:00,Exactly. And we don't care what miners have been asking for. They serve us. That's it. That's their only purpose.
9314,2017-07-16 09:00,3 mos is time to realize that forcing split isnt best course. Only way to keep one currency is no HF yet. Hopefully we'll get a price signal
9315,2017-07-16 09:00,Second most likely outcome is no consensus rule changes for near term future. Both completely acceptable. Third is split. That's the bad one
9316,2017-07-16 09:00,Most likely out come is hashpower enforced Segwit activation and then no HF happens. Forced HF without consensus is red line for many users

9320,2017-07-13 09:00,I don't think it's easy to broker such a deal with entire community. But as of now both sides are saying activate 141 in time to avoid split
9321,2017-07-13 09:00,The idea that the science of cryptocurrency isn't advancing is crazy. We've come so far in last couple years but have much further to go.
9322,2017-07-13 09:00,Preaching to the choir. We can revisit all this when BIP 141 expires if miners don't want to activate it as is.

9332,2017-07-12 03:00,"I 100% agree that it's very unlikely for a coin other than Bitcoin to succceed but that's why it's absurd, it's a self defeating prophecy."

9334,2017-07-11 19:00,So let's say in the end it's too hard to change BTC much but Mimblewimble does everything right and succeeds. Couldn't that be a success?
9335,2017-07-11 18:00,Thats absurd but what'd be wrong w/ that? Are we building BTC or cryptocurrency future? Who cares which coin as long as has right properties

9360,2017-07-03 07:00,Bitcoin not very useful for this thanks to you and your Blockstream buddies.
9361,2017-07-02 16:00,I'd never heard of Calvin Ayre. Thanks for the clue.

9388,2017-06-19 09:00,Non-conservative is reflective of actual conditions. Only reason to use conservative is if CPFP or RBF is not an option if conditions change

9390,2017-06-18 07:00,Is this estimatesmartfee? 1 just uses answer for 2. Try 504 instead of 512. Meaningfully different because 504 allows trying 95% for 2*504

9396,2017-06-12 07:00,It's both. Bitcoin is changeable. But derives most of its value vs fiat from the fact that there is no entity that can govern that change.
9397,2017-06-09 10:00,IMO support for HF has to be built. Takes time. And all efforts to date of definitively declaring a HF is happening don't help build support
9398,2017-06-09 10:00,You have to balance that against pushing through changes that don't have widespread support. That's also a huge ecosystem risk.
9399,2017-06-09 10:00,Agreed. Ideally.

9443,2017-04-07 21:00,The idea that it's a small group of Core devs blocking progress is absurd. This is the collective action of entire community. Stop blaming.
9444,2017-04-07 21:00,The proper takeaway is maybe ppl working on Core get that it's a bad idea to try to force rule changes on the community if not widely wanted
9445,2017-04-07 21:00,Your words imply Core is doing wrong. What you really mean is community has attacked contentious attempts to change existing rules.
9446,2017-04-07 13:00,I'm pretty sure Core doesn't want any of those
9447,2017-04-07 07:00,"Patent issues aside, I'm not sure anything is wrong with having done this historically. But doesn't mean we want it in future, use version."

9505,2017-03-24 21:00,that's the magic of segwit. It is a block size increase while simultaneously adhering to the existing 1MB rule.

9601,2017-03-07 06:00,honestly I thought thats what they said but they would probably use personal judgement to overrule
9602,2017-03-06 04:00,nothing ethically wrong with splitting. Agreed. What happens to value of one or both chains is a big open question.
9603,2017-03-05 19:00,Was Classic the one where ppl vote on consensus rules using some guys web app? It wasn't even a serious effort.
9604,2017-03-05 19:00,This is just wrong though. Who was behind a 2MB HF then and not now? HK didn't stop anything. Classic was DOA.

9617,2017-03-04 12:00,The main problem is no one can know. It's uncharted territory. In 20 years we might have insight into who was right/wrong.

9639,2017-02-15 10:00,Everyone validates everyone else's transactions. This is the fundamental premise of Bitcoin. That doesn't scale.
9640,2017-02-15 07:00,"to be clear, I think very unlikely we agree on HF block size increase in near future. Opportunity has passed. Just personal opinion"
9641,2017-02-15 07:00,the basic math is you can't put everything on chain. Not that 1MB is the only workable limit. BU is not a serious proposal.
9642,2017-02-15 07:00,yes. Can't solve scaling only by on chain is what I mean. Not that we couldn't ever have bigger block size if we can agree.

9648,2017-02-14 08:00,not quite right. miners can censor at will. Users choose whether to accept as new rules or temp obstruction.
9649,2017-02-14 08:00,They decide block size only for themselves. As does everyone else. Value potentially maximized if we can agree.
9650,2017-02-14 07:00,"just the other day @gavinandresen defined BTC as miners decide block size, also unreasonable. Same with BU."
9651,2017-02-14 07:00,my point is BIP 101 was completely unreasonable and supported by most/all big blockers.

9654,2017-02-14 06:00,Basic math is that it makes no sense for everyone in world to see and validate everyone elses every little transaction.

9656,2017-02-14 06:00,"Yes it's self-reinforcing. More divided community gets, more insane it is to still try HF. I've changed my mind."
9657,2017-02-14 05:00,key point is part of the community (you included) doesn't want 4 or 11. They want infinite. I'm not interested in that coin.
9658,2017-02-14 05:00,I think itll work but maybe it doesnt satisfy all use or catch on. Point is scaling on chain doesnt work regardless
9659,2017-02-14 05:00,It can grow slowly eventually if all agree but cant serve as only solution for increased demand which is what people want now
9660,2017-02-13 19:00,"Let's be clear. If LN doesnt work, we still cant scale on chain. Its basic math. We'll have to find another solution. Dctrlzd money is hard!"

9662,2017-02-12 16:00,Certainly agree but I fear too many don't value lack of central control. This is the crux of the division.

9666,2017-02-10 08:00,Users need only one thing: other users. Exchanges/miners follow value created by user consensus.

9763,2018-02-11 01:00,"Adding an address to the wallet causes a 'rescan' which is a different operation from 'reindex', that involves scanning over blocks from disk for transactions matching the wallet. It does not validate signatures at all."

9765,2018-02-09 10:00,"Yes, afaik a reindex does the same validation of blocks on disk as of blocks that normally come from the network."
9766,2018-02-09 10:00,Could also time a full reindex. It's not exactly the same (different i/o workload due to reading blocks from disk instead of network) but the verification is the same. Remember to set a high dbcache :)

10420,2018-01-30 20:00,"When I was in art school IIRC the requirements were a points system, with a few categories that you'd have to meet a given number of points in. So you had tremendous control over your curriculum, and on top of that teachers were incredibly flexible."
10421,2018-01-30 20:00,"OTOH, had I been in engineering at the same school, I'd have a fixed course schedule, with IIRC the only variation allowed in first year being one or two electives. Also, you couldn't take engineering part time, as I was doing with physics."
10422,2018-01-30 20:00,"Varies a lot, even within the same university. For instance, as I was in Physics, IIRC I could take any one of three parallel tracks of calculus classes, and outside of that had a fair amount of free choice."
10423,2018-01-30 20:00,"So in fact, some people switched *to* my class as the semester progressed because they dropped the even harder version of it; the people who were dropping it were probably switching to the next easier variant."
10424,2018-01-30 20:00,The crazy thing is I wasn't even taking the hardest class! I was taking the second hardest version of that course - they had about five different variations of the first-year calculus courses.
10425,2018-01-30 20:00,"IIRC the first day there weren't actually quite enough seats for everyone in the class, as they had overbooked knowing that there'd be enough seats in another two or three weeks."
10426,2018-01-30 20:00,"Yeah, the first year, first semester, calculus and analysis course I took had something like a 80% drop out rate in my class in the first month or two, and even in second semester IIRC around 10% dropped out."
10427,2018-01-30 20:00,"Yup, sounds very much like my experience. From what I've heard the particular classes I was taking were an unusually hard way of doing it so my experience may not be representative of most Canadian unis (I know for a fact the engineering calculus courses at that uni were easier)."
10428,2018-01-30 20:00,"For example, rather than, say, just teaching you that d/dx sin(x) = cos(x), the goal of the class was to have you be able to prove *why* that's true with limit proofs. Those kinds of proofs are easy to memorize, but really, really, difficult to derive yourself without peeking."
10429,2018-01-30 20:00,"As I said elsewhere, I was in a position in my career that marks didn't matter _that_ much to me - I was already working full time in engineering, and taking physics part time. So I mostly looked at that broken system with amusement. :)"
10430,2018-01-30 20:00,"Yeah, I don't blame those students for taking that approach; many teachers cautioned against it, but they weren't going to outright try to ban it.

10432,2018-01-30 20:00,"You still need some skill of course, as some things lend themselves to combinatorial combinations of problems. But once you figure out how to separate them you can brute force the underlying classes of problem (which of course is what lower level rout equation manipulation is!)."
10433,2018-01-30 20:00,"Basically, they'd get every test and exam that the teachers had ever made, and put every problem into categories - throwing out the trivial variations. So a study guide was simply every problem category you might run into an the answer to it."
10434,2018-01-30 20:00,"What level of math did you teach? Remember that this was fairly high level, so there just aren't that many unique problems out there at all; only so many different things you can ask a student to prove. For context, a study guide for the crammers would be ~100 pages/test."

10438,2018-01-30 19:00,"My teachers were generally pretty good about that; some of them even specifically told you not to try to cram for the tests by memorizing solved problems, and told you exactly this as to why you shouldn't do that. I'm sure everything I'm saying here is fairly well known."
10439,2018-01-30 19:00,"There's nothing unmeritocratic about trying to hire for what you actually need rather than a less-relevant metric that doesn't match your actual requirements. For example, I wouldn't place much emphasis on Chess tournament scores when hiring engineers."
10440,2018-01-30 19:00,"Remember that the goal of these classes is not to teach you how to answer questions on tests that you've seen before, but rather, how to solve completely novel problems with math. The big problem is there isn't a limitless supply of completely novel problems."
10441,2018-01-30 19:00,"You'd see this in test results for the (rare) times that the teachers could come up with a sufficiently new problem that the cramming students didn't have it in their study guides (which incidentally, were prepared by companies outside the university)."
10442,2018-01-30 19:00,"I and a few students who studied with me _did_ do better on the tests, but only for problems that neither group of student had seen the answers for. That's precisely why the cramming students thought we were so good: we could answer questions on _new_ material in class."
10443,2018-01-30 19:00,"See, some people are just brilliant. The aim of the courses I was taking was to help you become that level of brilliance, and one way to do that appears to be by stuggling hard against piles of problems without answers."
10444,2018-01-30 19:00,"When there's only something like 1000 problems that teachers over the years have come up with for that topic, you can easily screw up your entire ability to learn that creative process because you've spoiled for yourself all the possible study material."
10445,2018-01-30 19:00,"Remember that this is relatively high level math I'm talking about, not highschool level mechanical solving of problems. Solving problems you had never seen before helped you learn to be creative; seeing the answers screwed up that process."
10446,2018-01-30 19:00,"The definitely is really simple: if you get the math, you can solve any problem based on that math, not just specific problems. Those cram-dependent students who had asked me for help had the problem that they could answer specific problems they had seen, but not in general."
10447,2018-01-30 18:00,"I personally wasn't in that position, as at the time I was already working almost full-time in my chosen career doing analog electronics design at a startup. I was doing a physics degree part time because I genuinely wanted to learn physics for my career. I just needed to pass."
10448,2018-01-30 18:00,"Though to their credit, I think many of the students who learned by cramming answers understood what the problem was in why they weren't learning the actual math. But when advancement is geared to test results, there's strong incentives to cram."
10449,2018-01-30 18:00,"Those students themselves told me that. That's what was so strange about it - I'd have those students come to *me* asking me for help in understanding the math, yet they were getting better marks than me."
10450,2018-01-30 18:00,"My marks in linear algebra were far better than calculus/analytics, yet I learned practically nothing. tl;dr: School is a simulation of real learning. Although I'd 100% do it again and don't have a better alternative."
10451,2018-01-30 18:00,"So yes, those cramming study groups ruined it for everyone, including themselves. ...and funny enough, I had the same experience myself with linear algebra: I had very little intuition for it, so just crammed homework until I had it memorized."
10452,2018-01-30 18:00,"...they did very well on the tests. That said, there were some people who were so good in my study groups they not only groked the math, but could also ace the tests. But if you hired based on the tests, you'd also get a pile of hopeless students who'd never make anything new."
10453,2018-01-30 18:00,"In fact, I was very close to failing, and other top students"" weren't doing well either.

10454,2018-01-30 18:00,"This lead to a blizzare outcome for me: I was leading study groups, and getting a good understanding of the math. So my fellow students generally assumed I was one of the top students, along with some others in my study groups. But that wasn't true at all!"

10733,2018-01-03 18:00,Thanks! Though note how you can't just download a copy of the real SDK; looks like you at least need to contact them. #securitybyobscurity I'd feel better with a Raspberry PI running a OSS software stack in a relatively secure data center. :/
10734,2018-01-03 18:00,You're talking about a very different type of use-case than I am; I'm talking about HSM's used for online services like Bitcoin exchanges.
10735,2018-01-03 18:00,"You *already* have a major risk of physical server compromise: your devs laptops. If you can't solve that, then it's all hopeless anyway."
10736,2018-01-03 18:00,"Maybe I'm missing something, but where's the doc describing how I can run code on the HSM itself?"
10737,2018-01-03 18:00,"...and yes, I actually have lost data once due to accidentally overwriting a backup. :)"
10738,2018-01-03 17:00,"There's *also* an advantage on durability w/ blu-ray from what I've heard, as the data is actually written to vapor deposited metal film(1) with quite good longevity; SSD's can have a lifetime when off of as little as a year or two at elevated temperatures. 1) unlike CD/DVD's!"
10739,2018-01-03 17:00,Maybe. :)
10740,2018-01-03 17:00,I will say something nice though: I've yet to see such a set of requirements that was worse than none at all. :)
10741,2018-01-03 17:00,"Well, my experience may be selection bias: my exposure to those requirements comes from my clients, and it's possible that my clients happen to be unusually bad. But like I say, my experience with such requirements has so far been generally bad, with lots of security holes."
10742,2018-01-03 17:00,"Being read-only(1) only once written reduces risk of attacks, and mistakes, that change a backup after the fact. 1) In theory, the laser in a blu-ray read/writer can continue to modify a disk even after it has been finalized."
10743,2018-01-03 17:00,Got a link to the docs describing the sw environment in them?
10744,2018-01-03 17:00,"I think you have a pretty good understanding of the limitations of HSMs, but remember that lots of people seem to think they're magical. Also, limiting losses is hard: an attacker can often prevent you from learning about the losses until it's too late."
10745,2018-01-03 17:00,"For example, Yubikey offers the YubiHSM, which does a good job protecting passwords via rate-limiting. But that's all it does. ...and notice how a $4000 HSM doesn't do that job all that much better than the $400 YubiHSM!"
10746,2018-01-03 17:00,"That's what I mean by rate-limiting and auditing: the physical security over the key of an HSM can provide some guarantees, but usually those guarantees don't help much because the HSM doesn't run business logic. The very rare exceptions that do are another matter of course."
10747,2018-01-03 17:00,"Those compliance and security requirements are generally garbage frankly. A lot more banking gets hacked than gets publicly reported(1). It's easier to cover up because in banking, thefts can be reversed. 1) A _lot_ of BTC thefts get covered up too."
10748,2018-01-03 17:00,"In the specific type of attack we're talking about they *might* help if you've truly locked down the system controlling the HSM, but an attacker who can read arbitrary memory can probably find a way to login to your system, and from there, tell the HSM to give them all the BTC."
10749,2018-01-03 17:00,"This is a really good question, and unfortunately the answer is probably not. HSM's are semi-snakeoil, except for niche purposes such as rate-limiting and auditing; ~all HSM's will sign whatever the host computer tells them too, presenting little barrier for attackers. https:// twitter.com/UncryptWill/st atus/948710954585542656 …"
10750,2018-01-03 17:00,"The answer is simple: there is no longest chain rule. Longest chain is simply a broken design, which is why Satoshi replaced it with most-work years ago. And yes, the original Satoshi whitepaper got this wrong!"
10751,2018-01-03 17:00,Got a blog post on this? #SecurityByObscurity
10752,2018-01-03 17:00,"The format doesn't seem to be going anywhere, but you can still easily buy new disks and readers, so I'm not worried about obsolescence any time soon."
10753,2018-01-03 17:00,"FWIW, it's *also* common for banks/etc. to use cloud hosting. Although that's more of a privacy concern than a theft concern, as conventional banking can reverse transactions mostly at all... Might explain why I once had a brand new Visa card #get stolen before it even arrived!"
10754,2018-01-03 17:00,My #1 backup mechanism: encrypted blu-ray disks. My #1 data transfer mechanism: USB disks.

10766,2018-01-02 09:00,"The main thing is both @tierion and @opentimestamps just prove data existed prior to a point in time; they prove nothing about the non-existent of alternative versions of that data. In the context of identity, neither system prevents inconsistent identities from being made."

10842,2018-02-26 16:00,No. The rate of blocks is one per 10 minutes. It's only when picking blocks based on a random point in time (rather than a random block) you get the average 20 minutes. This is because you're more likely to be randomly looking during a longer block than a shorter block.
10843,2018-02-26 15:00,It's 10 minutes on average between random blocks. It's 20 minutes between the blocks when chosen based on a random point in time between them (which is biased towards longer blocks).
10844,2018-02-26 15:00,"It is true for random points in time. And times at which transactions are created (or better: the time that you happen to look at how long it's been) are uncorrelated with blocks, so they can be treated as uniformly random times."
10845,2018-02-26 15:00,"I formulated the question differently, by making it explicit that I start with a random point in time.

11104,2018-02-24 17:00,"I agree its not ideal, no question, but it seems very stretched to claim that it will be worse than Bitcoin today. Even just hiding payment destinations from first-hop nodes is probably almost better than Bitcoin today. Lots to be done in this space."
11105,2018-02-24 17:00,"It depends on defaults in software, really. Multi-channel payments means there is no (non-chain-fee) reason to not open quite a few channels, which helps a lot. Also, onion routing means even if you route everything through one node they only learn values and times."

12589,2017-04-19 14:00,"obv not advocating for doing this, only pointing out that the P2P network is a means to an end, not that decentralization is the goal"
12590,2017-04-19 14:00,"OK, 3 sattellites..indeed, the spof thing is an issue, but can be easily federated. Point being its still more censorship resistant than P2P"
12591,2017-04-19 14:00,"Unclear, there is lots of spare bandwidth on sattellites already in the sky, as long as you dont want to run software on the sat :)"
12592,2017-04-19 14:00,"neither is perfect, but censorship resistance is the point, not decentralization. See http:// bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2016/01/14/dec entralization/ … :)"

12596,2017-04-19 14:00,"(of course sats dont have infinite bandwidth, so you need DoS protection, but still doesnt have to be full validation)"
12597,2017-04-19 14:00,(as it is significantly more censorship resistant)
12598,2017-04-19 14:00,"full nodes listen to this feed and accept blocks which they validate. This would be a great system, in fact better than bitcoin today..."

12600,2017-04-19 14:00,Interesting thought experiment that I proposed in a discussion with @Steven_McKie : why does Bitcoin have a P2P network at all?...
12601,2017-04-19 13:00,"Maybe I'm confused on the point, sounds like you're advocating this just as a signal to miners? More reasonable, then,but put it in nVersion"

12707,2017-04-09 15:00,Why do you find it unlikely they might use the most undetectable version? HW evidence would be FPGA ROMs which are programmed at boot
12708,2017-04-09 15:00,"I'm not sure a single such miner is required for such a fork, though up to users if they're willing to lose a 10-20% of hashrate in a UASF"
12709,2017-04-09 15:00,So? There are several undetectable asicboost implementations... If your scan the chain and find nothing you haven't discovered anything
12710,2017-04-09 15:00,"So whether consensus can be had to disable it entirely or not, disabling the undetectable versions is a must"

12742,2017-04-09 13:00,Bitcoin has a long history of trying and failing to do so. Not sure why you think the future will be drastically different?
12743,2017-04-09 13:00,"Heh, yay Twitter's shitty threading... See my response at https:// twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/st atus/851162011077533696 … I think that's the biggest blocker these days."
12744,2017-04-09 13:00,"(as consensus will likely require smtg which accounts for massive uncertainty, ensuring we don't commit to smth where miners can't get paid)"
12745,2017-04-09 13:00,"I would, however, encourage you to look at historical transaction growth trends and try to determine future growth which maintains security"
12746,2017-04-09 13:00,"I'm pretty sure you're not gonna get consensus for that, but feel free to try. Point being, without consensus, Bitcoin keeps the status quo!"
12747,2017-04-09 13:00,"There are many workarounds, including some things that have been in Core for years, but they all still require a real fee market"
12748,2017-04-09 13:00,I didn't say that? Only commented on the lack of consensus and need for eventual fees. Still strongly support gradual capacity increases!
12749,2017-04-09 13:00,"But, really, you seem to have missed the whole first paragraph. See-also https:// twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/st atus/845081397383520258 … for more places you can troll"

12764,2017-04-09 12:00,I'd recommend those who don't understand to spend a few months contributing before they start speaking about it :)

12774,2017-04-09 09:00,Maybe we should also call out BU for openly funding trolling where they actually have control
12775,2017-04-07 03:00,"You mean social grinding attacks? ;) Anyway, yea, Greg pointed it out in a subclause, totally reasonable that folks missed it"
12776,2017-04-07 01:00,Note that greg's stated optimization does *not* require shuffling of transactions.

13231,2017-02-07 20:00,"it is also not making things worse, unlike naive block-size-increase-HF proposals"
13232,2017-02-07 20:00,"the fee-discount for using segwit helps a lot, but, sure, it is not a complete fix, just a massive first step"
13233,2017-02-07 20:00,"and, yes, segwit is also a sighashing fix (with some additional tweaks over time) and massive increase in on-chain txn"

13235,2017-02-07 20:00,"3rd party malleability destroys contracting applications, though"
13236,2017-02-07 20:00,it clearly solves malleability where malleability needs solving. 3rd-party malleability fixes for normal wallets are 3 LOC today
13237,2017-02-07 20:00,"the point is to fix malleability for those who need it, which is contacting applications, and SegWit clearly does"

13242,2017-02-07 20:00,note that time-locked transactions where you still have the key are half-useless - they're trivial to double-spend
13243,2017-02-07 20:00,oh totally! This is why consensus changes are always so carefully reviewed - simple things can go horribly wrong
13244,2017-02-07 20:00,depends on the exact nature... Any SF or HF could cause this issue: it's one we're always super painfully aware of
13245,2017-02-07 20:00,either way we probably can't confiscate those coins
13246,2017-02-07 20:00,"That's, sadly, the point... For all we know all UTXOs before 2011 are on this setup... Or none"

13248,2017-02-07 20:00,or maybe you migrated to a new wallet but also wanted to time-lock in the process
13249,2017-02-07 20:00,many reasons - maybe two distrusting parties want to lock in coins to a contract so multisig+timelock+throw away coins
13250,2017-02-07 20:00,what about txn that spend time locked coins that already exist (and possibly no longer have keys)?
13251,2017-02-07 20:00,which part?
13252,2017-02-07 20:00,Good thing bitcoin has multiple security models or many would have walked away years ago

13255,2017-02-07 20:00,"in fact, CLTV only enforces that nLockTime be set, not actually directly enforces lock-out"
13256,2017-02-07 20:00,"nope, a common use-case is to sign then throw away the key. Also, CLTV doesn't change anything"
13257,2017-02-07 20:00,great! Now go read recent bitcoin-dev posts on HF design and see how tricky anti-replay is :)
13258,2017-02-07 19:00,"transactions have a nLockTime field, always have, which prevents inclusion in a block until that time"

16541,2017-12-22 08:00,You cannot use bitcoin without trusting others unless YOU run a node YOURSELF. That's all the incentive you need.

16544,2017-12-22 08:00,Of course it can. If users abandon the old chain nobody will mine it. For example in freicoin's case. What's subjective about a chain being abandoned?
16545,2017-12-22 08:00,"But it has to be in bitcoin or he won't be happy. Doing what he wants is not enough, he wants to force other users to do as he wants too. That's why he advocated for miners to attack the minority chain"" (although now he doesn't advocate to attack bcash)."""
16546,2017-12-22 08:00,My definition is also concrete. And I don't see the problem with it. We keep the name bitvoin unless we all agree to a hardfork. What's the problem again?
16547,2017-12-22 08:00,"It worked for freicoin, but perhaps the bitcoin community is too big for that already. I hope not because there's hardforks I want, like bip99 itself."
16548,2017-12-22 08:00,People who don't care about trusting others have plenty of options like paypal or just SEPA transfers. People who don't want to trust others need bitcoin and a full node.
16549,2017-12-22 07:00,"I don't think it makes sense to implemwnt a pow chain as a sf. An emegency could be the need for qn emergency difficulty adjustment like freicoin had to (I mean a one time thing, not bcash's, which should have been named routine difficulty adjustment"")."""
16550,2017-12-22 07:00,"Yes, it has an 8 mb size limit."
16551,2017-12-22 07:00,It's not. That's the base for bip99's definition of uncontroversial.
16552,2017-12-22 07:00,"No, controversial is unambiguously defined in bip99: if no users oppose to upgrade and remain in the old chain, then it is uncontroversial. For example, freicoin's hf. Or all of bitcoin's softforks."
16553,2017-12-22 07:00,"The incentive is not to trust other people, which is precisely satoshi's motivation: reducing needed trust. If it wasn't for full nodes, your spv wallet couldn't even follow bcash's chain instead of bitcoin's chain which has higher hashrate."
16554,2017-12-22 07:00,I believe he really wants unlimited blocks. That's why no increase will ever be enough for him. That's why he proposed 20 gb blocks. I wish bcash or some other alt would fully remove the limit to satisfy people who think like him.
16555,2017-12-22 07:00,But why would anyone mine something that nobody wants or uses? Like pre-hf freicoin?

16557,2017-12-22 07:00,Dp you run a bcash node?
16558,2017-12-22 07:00,"I fully disagree. Unlike bcash, Bitcoin is meant to be p2p."
16559,2017-12-22 07:00,"Right, and thus it would be more of an emergency hf than an uncontroversial hf using bip99's classification."
16560,2017-12-22 07:00,But the old chain fully died for freicoin. It is possible. Perhaps that was more of an emergency hardfork by bip99's classification.
16561,2017-12-22 07:00,"If there are people using the old chain, then the hf is not controversial as defined by bip99 and then I guess my last definition of bitcoin"", the old chain would be ""the real bitcoin""."""
16562,2017-12-22 07:00,"Perhaps not. Freicoin was a very small community at the time, and still is. Perhaps an uncontroversial hardfork as defined by bip99 is no longer possible for bitcoin. I hope it is possible."
16563,2017-12-22 07:00,"No, I don't think I'm contradicting myself. The key subtlety here being if it is the same currency"". And yes freicoin was only 1 currency pre and post hf. The same cannot be said about eth/etc though."""
16564,2017-12-22 07:00,"No, it's not the same chain and thus is not the same currency. You can't pay a user of the original code using a bcash wallet. And the code it's not the same, obviously you have to change a few things to use bitcoin core's code to criticize bitcoin core..."
16565,2017-12-22 07:00,"Right, it is still possible to sync with the current chain with the original client. It's just very very slow."
16566,2017-12-22 07:00,"Well, if a hf is uncontroversial the chain with the old rules simply gets abandoned, so I guess in that case you can still consider it the same currency. For example, freicoin had a hf, but 0 users stayed with the old rules (and thus 0 miners too)."
16567,2017-12-22 07:00,"Of course, otherwise he couldn't support current blocks, which are bigger than 1 mb thanks to segwit."
16568,2017-12-22 07:00,"As explained in the whitepaper, even if an attacker gets a hashrate majority, that doesn't mean the system becomes open to arbitrary changes. Section 11, first paragraph. Check it out."
16569,2017-12-22 07:00,"What about the following: if it's the same currency that was accessible using the original code, then it's bitcoin. If it's a newer currency, then it's not bitcoin."

16581,2017-12-19 18:00,So when blocks get to 2 mb you will keep saying segwit is not a size increase? Don't you think the only thing you achieve with that is discrediting yourself?
16582,2017-12-19 18:00,But it is not a fake increase. Blocks are bigger than 1 mb today. Some times as big as 1.5 mb even with only about 10% segwit adoption. Who told you it is a fake increase? They lied to you. Just check it out on any block explorer.
16583,2017-12-19 18:00,Blocks bigger than 2 mb in size are possible with segwit. We just need more segwit adoption.

16873,2017-11-29 18:00,"Just like you can decide to use something else with another size limit or with no size limit if you want and enough people want that too. But you can't force users to accept changes they don't want either, because they can run a full node and reject blocks invalid for them."
16874,2017-11-29 18:00,"But they can if they want, that's the whole point. Even without running full nodes, they can still decide the rules of the currency they accept, hold and buy indiriectly. just like users can chose between bitcoin, bcash or freicoin, for example."
16875,2017-11-29 18:00,"No, when I say users I don't mean ip addresses, I mean people who use bitcoin, each of them has the power to decide which rules the currency he uses, holds and accepts follow. When I want to mean ip addresses, I simply say ip addresses, it's much more clear this way."

17343,2017-10-22 15:00,I'm pretty sure they will. They will come back to mine bitcoin when they realise the market prefers it over 2xcoin
17344,2017-10-22 15:00,Segwit txs are as much bitcoon txs as p2sh txs or any other bitcoin tx

17349,2017-10-22 14:00,But there's no base size in the code. It seems clear you can't prove me wrong about that despite calling me a liar.
17350,2017-10-22 14:00,But factom is not of my interest and doesn't introduce new consensus rules for bitcoin

17352,2017-10-22 13:00,"No base size check there, only the weight check."
17353,2017-10-22 13:00,It does because I want to validate the same consensus rules other segwit nodes full nodes validate to stay on the same chain

17359,2017-10-22 11:00,Old nodes don't see the full blocks. They should upgrade to get full blocks and validate segwit rules.

17362,2017-10-22 11:00,The definition of size never changed. There was no definition of weight before segwit.

17376,2017-10-22 03:00,What did I make up? Blocks are bigger than 1 mb. That's a simple fact anyone can verify.
17377,2017-10-22 03:00,Because they can have a block weight bigger than 4 MB (upp to 8 mb weight). My node rejects blocks with weight bigger than 4 mb

17800,2017-10-04 15:00,I do get to define what is bitcoin on my node.
17801,2017-10-04 15:00,"Not necessarily number of txs but, ok. Still increasing the limit allows blocks of that size."
17802,2017-10-04 15:00,"Again, it was miners who blocked segwit from 2016 to aug 2017. It's been implemented for a long time."
17803,2017-10-04 15:00,It is a rushed hf that will cause a split because it's controversial. Its design can be greatly improved. We just rose the size limit in aug
17804,2017-10-04 15:00,Or say things against sw that simply weren't true.
17805,2017-10-04 15:00,"Again,sw was a compromise by increasing the size.But they usually didn't say anything they didn't like about sw,just more things they wanted"

17809,2017-10-04 14:00,"As said, no need for any of that unless the price of bitcoin (don't confuse with x2coin) crashes after the hf. why would we change the name?"

17813,2017-10-04 13:00,"if it's profitable to mine it as I expect, I won't advocate either. But if we do a one time EDA perhaps adding replay protection makes sense"
17814,2017-10-04 13:00,there's nothing to disagree on that tweet. That sw is a size increase and that many users don't want the x2 hf are indisputable facts.
17815,2017-10-04 13:00,you remind me of gavin advising miners to attack the minority chain.
17816,2017-10-04 13:00,"I want to get what I want but I don't care about bch users getting what they want too. I'm fine with you getting the x2, just don't want it"
17817,2017-10-04 13:00,"btc just recently got a size increase with segwit. Many users don't want another one at this point, so there will be 2 coins."
17818,2017-10-04 13:00,"If you expect x2coin to be the only coin, you need to expect the price of the old chain to crash below profitability (and more)"
17819,2017-10-04 13:00,why would we get a very low hashrate unless the price crashes? what makes you thik the price will crash?
17820,2017-10-04 13:00,So your hope is that many users can't get what they want and that the price of bitcoin(don't confuse with x2coin) crashes after the hf.Noted
17821,2017-10-04 13:00,My point is signaling in bitcoin is not the full hashrate. hashrate moves from btc to bch and will move from x2 to btc to bch too.

17826,2017-10-04 10:00,Then you must know we users have a good reason to reject x2. sw was a compromise and didn't satisfied some of those who said wanted size inc

17831,2017-10-04 09:00,That's equivalent to completely removing the limit today. That's removing thw mqin limit to cwntralization.

17836,2017-10-03 23:00,My node is economically important to me and it matters to me.
17837,2017-10-03 22:00,"Segwit's size increase could have been activated in 2016, but miners blocked it until august 2017. Blame them."
17838,2017-10-03 22:00,Let me guess...apart from not seeing the need for the limit you also don't feel the need to run a full node and you don't?

17860,2017-10-02 16:00,"Yes technocally is an increase, blocks can be bigger than 1 mb by using sw txs because the 1mb size limit has been replaced with 4 mb weight"

17971,2017-09-28 20:00,It is completely accurate. It is users who devide the consensus rules and give value to the currency and thus the reward miners mine.

17999,2017-09-28 17:00,Consensus means 100% agreement. I wish people wouldn't use that word for agreement because it's often confused with the consensus rules.

20063,2017-06-06 09:00,some because tey need to upgrade more than bitcoin core or directly don't use bitoin core. others because they oppose bip148
